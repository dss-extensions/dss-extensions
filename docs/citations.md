# Citations

Follow the links for citations on publications and use of DSS-Extensions on third-party repositories.

Note that there are more publications and the document hasn't been updated since April 2023. Unfortunately many authors only cite OpenDSS and omit details like versions and which package was actually used.

Although neither list is complete, these can be used as reference and show how DSS-Extensions can be used in a variety of scenarios.
