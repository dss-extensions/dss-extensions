# Third-Party Repositories

This is a collection of links to repositories that either use one of the projects under DSS-Extensions, or list them as working alternatives. [Follow here](https://dss-extensions.org/citations.html) for a list of papers that reference DSS-Extensions.

GitHub also lists some of the repositories directly as dependents, including other repositories not listed here:

- https://github.com/dss-extensions/DSS-Python/network/dependents
- https://github.com/dss-extensions/OpenDSSDirect.py/network/dependents
- https://github.com/dss-extensions/dss_sharp/network/dependents

No curation has been done. Licenses, state of development, maturity and support vary. When in doubt, please contact the authors of each repository.

The table is sorted by URL, that automatically groups by author/organization.

*[Please feel free to open an issue or PR](https://github.com/dss-extensions/dss-extensions) if you wish to include/update/exclude your repository link or paper.*
