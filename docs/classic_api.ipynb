    "# OpenDSS COM/classic APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "*Main concepts of the classic OpenDSS APIs*\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is intended to expose some concepts that are typically overlook by many users when using the classic OpenDSS API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, all OpenDSS interfaces and bindings use the same concepts of interaction with the DSS engine. That includes most of the projects developed under DSS-Extensions, \n",
    "\n",
    "On DSS-Extensions, an alternative API is being developed to complement and/or provide a difference experience. Currently, the main results are represented in the [AltDSS-Python](https://dss-extensions.org/AltDSS-Python/) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid generating confusion, we will use the term \"classic API\" to indicate a set of APIs that follow the concepts developed in the official OpenDSS COM implementation, and \"Alt\" or alternative API for whatever is being developed in AltDSS-Python and similar projects, such as `dss.hpp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenDSS has models for many electric components and controllers, plus general data classes. Besides those, there are several interfaces to interact with specific aspects of the engine. The [official documentation](https://opendss.epri.com/opendss_documentation.html) and other training material usually covers those in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## API Hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "The API tree as seen from walking from the main interface class `IDSS`, which is exposed from `OpenDSSengine.DSS` in the COM interface, is as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "For EPRI's OpenDSS implementation, the API materialize in the `OpenDSSengine.DSS` COM object exposes the OpenDSS engine, which is a global singleton in the engine side. That means that the same engine is exposed even if you create another COM object. On DSS-Extensions, the default instance is also created by default for compatibility with the global singleton, but users can create multiple engines by using the `dss.NewContext()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Items marked with \"API Extension\" are not present in the COM API, but available as extras on DSS-Extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- dss (`IDSS`)\n",
    "    - (dss.)ActiveClass (`IActiveClass`): Manipulate DSS classes directly. For example, if a class doesn't have a dedicated API, this can be used to access the element properties. This is the same as \"dss.ActiveCircuit.ActiveClass\".\n",
    "    - (dss.)DSSProgress (`IDSSProgress`): Manipulate the progress status, GUI etc. *Using this is uncommon.* Not fully supported on DSS-Extensions without custom callbacks.\n",
    "    - (dss.)DSSim_Coms (`IDSSimComs`): Using this is uncommon. Also exposed as \"dss.ActiveCircuit.DSSim_Coms\".\n",
    "    - (dss.)Error (`IError`): The error interface lists error numbers and descriptions. On the official OpenDSS, users need to check this manually if `AllowForms` is disabled. On DSS-Extensions, most errors are directly mapped to errors or exceptions, depending on the programming language.\n",
    "    - (dss.)Events (`IDSSEvents`): The event interface allows using event callbacks that are triggered in certain points of the solution process. *Using this is uncommon.*\n",
    "    - (dss.)Executive (`IDSS_Executive`): Lists the available commands and options, help strings. Allow manipulating options. *Using this is uncommon.*\n",
    "    - (dss.)Parser (`IParser`): Parsing utilities. Using this is uncommon.\n",
    "    - (dss.)Text (`IText`): Pass DSS commands and get results from the DSS engine.\n",
    "    - (dss.)ZIP (`IZIP`) (**API Extension**): Allow loading circuits from ZIP files, without extracting files to the disk.\n",
    "    - (dss.)ActiveCircuit (`ICircuit`): this is effectively the same as `Circuits` (omitted). Contains many properties and methods to access the circuit state, plus the interfaces below.\n",
    "        - ***General engine and circuit operations***\n",
    "        - (dss.ActiveCircuit.)CtrlQueue (`ICtrlQueue`): Inspect or manipulate the control event queue.\n",
    "        - (dss.ActiveCircuit.)Parallel (`IParallel`): OpenDSS Parallel-machine features. *Using this is uncommon.* On DSS-Extensions, prefer native multithreading couple with `dss.NewContext()` instead.\n",
    "        - (dss.ActiveCircuit.)ReduceCkt (`IReduceCkt`): Circuit reduction operations.\n",
    "        - (dss.ActiveCircuit.)Topology (`ITopology`): Get general information like loops and isolated elements; iterate over the circuit graph. Requires an EnergyMeter.\n",
    "        - (dss.ActiveCircuit.)Settings (`ISettings`): Exposes some of the settings for the circuit, some for the whole engine. Some more options/settings are also directly in the main `IDSS` class.\n",
    "        - (dss.ActiveCircuit.)Solution (`ISolution`): Solution manipulation, including settings and general state.\n",
    "        - ***Bus operations***\n",
    "        - (dss.ActiveCircuit.)ActiveBus (`IBus`): Manipulate a specific bus. This is effectively the same as `Buses` (omitted).\n",

    "            - (dss.ActiveCircuit.ActiveCktElement.)Properties (`IDSSProperty`): Manipulate the DSS properties of the active element.\n",

    "## The \"Active...\" paradigm\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is activation?** In the context of OpenDSS, activation usually means select a certain object for manipulation at certain collections. The paradigm is used both in the classic API and in the internal code of OpenDSS, although the implementation on DSS-Extensions has been slowly moving away from that concept for the internal code.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important aspect to consider is that each class with a dedicated interface tracks an active object, and activating one object from the dedicated interfaces also activates it in the parent interfaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "**There is one exception.** The Lines API, as implemented in EPRI's OpenDSS distribution, does not track the lines by itself. Instead, it relies on the more general \"ActiveCktElement\". Unfortunately, any operation that changes the active circuit element then results in the Lines interface losing track of the current line. This was changed on DSS-Extensions to make the Lines API work like the other APIs, but there is a compatibility flag that could be used if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, activating a Load by name (`dss.ActiveCircuit.Loads.Name = \"target_load_name\"`), iteration (`dss.ActiveCircuit.Loads.First`, `dss.ActiveCircuit.Loads.Next`) or index (`dss.ActiveCircuit.Loads.idx = a_valid_integer_index`) through the Loads interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sets the target as the active load in the Loads interface.\n",
    "- **Does not** set \"ActiveDSSClass\" to the Load class.\n",
    "- Sets the target as the active circuit element (\"ActiveCktElement\").\n",
    "- Sets the target as the active DSS object (\"ActiveDSSElement\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**But** activating a Load from a more general interface does not activate it on all interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `dss.ActiveCircuit.SetActiveElement(\"Load.target_load_name\")` or the `Select` DSS command (`dss.Text.Command = \"Select Load.target_load_name\"`):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Does not** set the target as the active load in the Loads interface.\n",
    "- Sets \"ActiveDSSClass\" to the Load class.\n",
    "- Sets the target as the active circuit element (\"ActiveCktElement\").\n",
    "- Sets the target as the active DSS object (\"ActiveDSSElement\").\n",
    "\n",
    "`SetActiveElement` is specific to circuit elements, other general elements like LoadShape and Spectrum objects cannot be used with it. The `Select` DSS command, on the other hand, can be used with any DSS object.\n",
    "\n",
    "If \"ActiveDSSClass\" is set to the Load class, activating an element (`dss.ActiveCircuit.ActiveClass.Name = \"target_load_name\"`):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Does not** set the target as the active load in the Loads interface.\n",
    "- The \"ActiveDSSClass\" is kept as the Load class.\n",
    "- Sets the target as the active circuit element (\"ActiveCktElement\").\n",
    "- Sets the target as the active DSS object (\"ActiveDSSElement\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Important takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only when activating the element through the dedicated interfaces activates it there.\n",
    "- Most ways to activate elements sets \"ActiveCktElement\" and \"ActiveDSSElement\". A user can only interact with an element at a time through the more general interfaces.\n",
    "- With the exception of Lines in EPRI's official OpenDSS, one can safely use the dedicated interfaces to access some of the data/state. For example, it is safe to use the Loads interface and the Transformers interface in succession without reactivating the elements.\n",
    "- The PDElements interface uses the current ActiveCktElement, so anything that changes that will affect the PDElements interface too.\n",
    "- Other DSS commands can iterate through the internal collections and can change the active elements to point to something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since what is activated changes depending on the method used, if the object has a dedicated collection interface, it is recommended that users activate the object through this interface. Sometimes it also useful to activate the collection class using `dss.Circuit.SetActiveClass(\"load\")` or equivalent to complement it, especially for classes that do not expose all relevant properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"ActiveDSSClass\" interface does not track the active element as a dedicated reference. Instead, it uses the current \"ActiveDSSObject\", which can lead to some ill-defined scenarios. For example, it the \"Capacitor\" class is set active and then a Load is activated, the \"ActiveClassName\" can still be help as \"Capacitor\", but the element name return from \"ActiveDSSClass.Name\" is the Load name. See the code snippets for an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Buses\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the DSS objects, only a single bus can be activated and references cannot be help since the bus interfaces always reference to the active bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code snippets\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some code snippets in Python for illustration."
