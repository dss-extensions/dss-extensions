					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In the face of a substantial and uncertain growth of 
behind-the-meter Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), utilities and 
regulators are currently in the search for new network planning 
strategies for facilitating an efficient Transmission &amp; Distribution
 (T&amp;D) coordination. In this context, here we propose a novel 
distribution system planning methodology to facilitate coordinated 
planning exercises with transmission system planners through the 
management of long-term DER growth uncertainty and its impact on the 
substation netload. The proposed approach is based on the design of a 
transmission-aware distribution planning model embedding DER growth 
uncertainty, which is used to determine a “menu” of secure distribution 
network upgrade options with different associated costs and peak netload
 guarantees observed from the transmission-side, referred here as 
Netload Range Cost Curves (NRCCs). NRCCs can provide a practical 
approach for coordinating T&amp;D planning exercises, as these curves 
can be integrated into existing transmission planning workflows, and 
specify a direct incentive for distribution planners to evaluate peak 
netload reduction alternatives in their planning process. We perform 
computational experiments based on a realistic distribution network that
 demonstrate the benefits and applicability of our proposed planning 
approach.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The accurate topology and line parameters are crucial 
information for effective planning and controlling of the distribution 
systems. However, existing literature often assumes either full-scale 
deployment of micro-phasor measurement units (μPMUs) or the complete 
knowledge of the system topologies, which is unrealistic in practice. To
 address this, the author presents a deep learning-based approach for 
line parameter and topology estimation using historical measurements 
from μPMUs under partial observability. The proposed method incorporates
 a deep neural network (DNN) with a learnable regularizer, which takes 
into account the underlying system topology to achieve accurate and 
reliable line parameter and topology estimation. The proposed algorithm 
addresses the nonlinearity of power flows by unrolling the Gauss-Newton 
solver. This iterative process involves minimizing the losses and the 
learning regularization term alternatively. The proposed scheme’s 
performance is demonstrated on IEEE 33 test bus system, which showcases 
the algorithm’s efficacy.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Electric power systems are undergoing a transformation, 
characterized by an increase in power electronic converter interfaced 
technologies, e.g. wind and solar resources, FACTS devices, High-Voltage
 DC (HVDC) lines or power electronic interfaced loads. Increasing 
penetration of renewable energy resources, low gas prices, and the 
retirement of coal and nuclear power plants motivate the use of 
gas-fired power plants to mitigate the variability and uncertainty of 
wind and solar resources. The reliance on natural gas for electricity 
generation has increased over the past years in the US which comes with 
associated reliability and security risks due to the dependency an 
energy system may have on one another. Poor coordination between power 
and gas operations may compound the weaknesses of an already congested 
network. In addition, the proliferation of smart grid technologies that 
control distribution systems introduce higher levels of variability and 
uncertainty to the operation of power grids. In this research, we 
present a set of tools to model energy systems, including transmission 
and distribution power systems, or natural gas pipelines, and cyber 
networks. This framework is then used to devise algorithms that improve 
the security and reliability of interdependent energy systems and 
propose counter-measures against unexpected events.The first part of 
this thesis (Chapter 2) presents the models and algorithms to simulate 
and optimize North American power and gas delivery operations, both in 
transmission and distribution systems. The second part of this thesis 
(Chapter 3) provides novel datasets that aim to serve as a support to 
perform studies using the models proposed in Chapter 2. In this section,
 we focus our efforts in natural gas datasets in the continental United 
States, filling a gap in the literature and enabling academic studies of
 coupled natural gas and electricity delivery operations. In addition, 
we propose models to generate high-resolution and scalable solar time 
series to better capture the impacts of renewable energy uncertainty and
 variability on power system operations. The last part of this thesis 
(Chapters 4 and 5) studies the events that compromise security and 
reliability of energy systems from two different angles. We consider 
contingency events that are a result of a cyber-attack, e.g. perpetuated
 by a terrorist group or a nation-state, or due to natural 
circumstances, e.g. failure of a generator unit and extreme weather 
events. In these chapters, we propose algorithms and counter-measures to
 mitigate contingency events by ensuring that the system can operate in a
 safe and flexible secure region.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Distributed energy resources (DER) and control assets on the 
grid provide mechanisms to ensure voltage support and power quality, and
 can be used as a means to maintain voltages close to nominal values. In
 this work, we study the security region of a system in the presence of 
devices with. We focus our efforts on the dynamics of devices that apply
 discrete changes, such as voltage regulators or capacitor banks, and 
DERs that change the power injections with Volt/Var/Watt functionality. 
The slow dynamics of these devices, coupled through the power flow 
equations, are modeled as a switching dynamical system where the 
switching condition depends on the operating point of the system. We 
identify the feasible set of DER power injections that prevent the 
switching of devices and oscillations in the voltage profile, and 
formulate an optimization problem that finds a robust operating point 
for voltage control. This operating point is the center of the largest 
Euclidean ball inscribed in the security region, and the radius of the 
ball is the security margin of the system. We showcase our models using 
the IEEE test cases. Our work has applications in voltage control and 
distribution planning</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The ongoing electrification of the transportation fleet will 
increase the load on the electric power grid. Since both the 
transportation network and the power grid already experience periods of 
significant stress, joint analyses of both infrastructures will most 
likely be necessary to ensure acceptable operation in the future. To 
enable such analyses, this article presents an open-source testbed that 
jointly simulates high-fidelity models of both the electric distribution
 system and the transportation network. The testbed utilizes two 
open-source simulators, OpenDSS to simulate the electric distribution 
system and the microscopic traffic simulator SUMO to simulate the 
traffic dynamics. Electric vehicle charging links the electric 
distribution system and the transportation network models at vehicle 
locations determined using publicly available parcel data. Leveraging 
high-fidelity synthetic electric distribution system data from the 
SMART-DS project and transportation system data from OpenStreetMap, this
 testbed models the city of Greensboro, NC down to the household level. 
Moreover, the methodology and the supporting scripts released with the 
testbed allow adaption to other areas where high-fidelity geolocated 
OpenDSS datasets are available. After describing the components and 
usage of the testbed, we exemplify applications enabled by the testbed 
via two scenarios modeling the extreme stresses encountered during 
evacuations.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This article investigates the intricate dynamics between 
Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and the Microgrid Operator (MGO) 
within a microgrid interconnected with the main grid. Employing an 
evolutionary game framework, the study scrutinizes the strategic 
evolution of DERs’ decision-making processes in their interactions with 
the MGO. Modeled as an evolutionary game, these interactions encapsulate
 the strategies adopted by DERs, resulting in stable equilibrium 
strategies over time. Motivated by direct benefits linked to increased 
active power production, DERs strive to sell all available power, while 
the MGO focuses on optimizing the microgrid’s overall performance. The 
study assesses the microgrid’s performance in terms of its power factor,
 emphasizing the strategic balance DERs must achieve in their active 
power generation to avoid penalization. This penalization results in 
decreased individual utility for DERs due to the overall power factor 
decrease resulting from their prioritization of active power generation.
 Additionally, the diminished overall power factor implies a decrease in
 MGO utility. The individual utility of each DER is further influenced 
by the strategies adopted by other DERs, impacting the penalization 
factor. Leveraging a modified IEEE 13-node distribution microgrid 
consisting of three DERs, the study presents case studies encompassing 
both cooperative and non-cooperative evolutionary game scenarios. These 
case studies illuminate the intricacies of interactions and the 
resulting equilibrium outcomes.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Worldwide, the installed capacity of rooftop photovoltaic 
systems (PVs) has been increasing rapidly, faster than the traditional 
load increase rate. Differently from the loads, the simultaneity factor 
of rooftop PV generation is roughly 1.0, resulting in higher violations 
of technical and regulatory limits. One of the most widely adopted 
solutions to accommodate rooftop PVs is to perform grid reinforcements, 
such as reconductoring and circuit sectionalization. In several 
countries, the investments in grid reinforcement are transferred to the 
customers as energy tariff, impacting the economy. Because of that, the 
Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL) is dedicating efforts to
 estimating the benefits and costs of integrating distributed generators
 into the power systems. In this context, this paper presents a Monte 
Carlo-based methodology that obtains the marginal costs of grid 
reinforcement for a Brazilian distribution utility, i.e., how much the 
installation of 1 kWp of rooftop PV costs. It is shown that the order 
the PVs are installed strongly affects the marginal cost and that a 
small part of the circuits is responsible for most reinforcement costs. 
Utilities and regulatory agencies can adopt this method to perform 
similar estimations.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper discusses power smoothing in a Condominium 
Microgrid (ConGRID). The study considers using a Battery Energy Storage 
System (BESS) for power smoothing and its impact on distributed load and
 distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation. The microgrid under study, 
ConGRID, is located in a condominium in Barão Geraldo, Campinas, Brazil,
 and consists of real consumers with PV generation installed on their 
houses and a BESS connected at the point of common coupling. The paper 
provides a methodology for simulating power smoothing at ConGRID using 
OpenDSS, an electric grid simulator, using Simple Moving Average (SMA). 
The simulations were carried out using Python programming language with 
the support of the Google Colab environment. Results show that using the
 BESS for smoothing the distributed PV generation using an aggregated 
profile increases the power and voltage oscillations in the point of 
common coupling. However, when the smoothing algorithm uses the power at
 the distribution transformer as the reference, the strategy benefits 
the power system, reducing power and voltage oscillations between 
ConGRID and the main grid.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The increase of distributed generators and energy storage 
devices in modern distribution systems impacts the demand provided by 
the distribution utility and, hence, the techniques employed to 
determine the Transmission System Usage Amount at the border with the 
transmission system. If the contracted demand is violated, the utility 
must pay inefficiency charges. The complexity of this new reality is the
 stochastic characteristics associated with the new devices installed at
 medium and low voltage levels. In this context, this work proposes a 
methodology composed of a linear programming model to determine the 
demand to be contracted by the distribution utility. This work 
incorporates the problem uncertainties by integrating historical data 
and demand forecasting from the distribution utility and the Brazilian 
Energy Research Company. The developed methodology obtained a 1.5% error
 compared to the contracted demand which would lead to the minimum 
annual demand cost when applied to a Brazilian system.</td>

						<td>The paper proposes a methodology that combines the OpenDSS 
simulator with a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to 
determine the optimal microgrid operation at a University Campus. The 
microgrid is a distributed energy system integrating generation sources,
 energy storage, and loads. The proposed model considers the control of 
the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) and demands balancing as 
variables. The objective of the MILP is to optimize the microgrid 
operation by minimizing operational costs, maximizing the utilization of
 renewable energy, and ensuring the quality of energy supply. The 
proposed model is applied using data from the CampusGRID microgrid being
 implemented at UNICAMP in Campinas - SP, Brazil. The results 
demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving optimal microgrid operation, 
contributing to decision-making and efficient planning of distributed

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Currently, researchers and engineers have been dedicated to 
the development of more efficient and cost-effective implementation 
strategies to minimize the technical impacts caused by the connection of
 Electric Vehicle (EV) and Photovoltaic Distributed Generation (DGPV) in
 a Low-Voltage Distribution Network (LVDN). Although the embedded 
controls in DGPV inverters and EV chargers stand out for the 
aforementioned requirements, the costs incurred by national utilities 
are not evident during the joint operation of DGPV and EV under Volt-VAr
 control. This article presents an evaluation of the costs to utilities 
due to technical losses and compensations paid to consumers given the 
violation of voltage limits in steady-state conditions for LVDNs 
subjected to the joint connection of DGPV and EV with Volt-Var control. 
In this study, the networks are defined, along with the curves of EV 
chargers and PVDG, and residences with the joint connection of DGPV and 
EV. The simulations are based on a gradual increase in the combined 
penetration level in steps of 20%. The results obtained for two real 
networks demonstrate the high costs of compensation compared to 
technical losses and the effectiveness of local Volt-Var control in 
reducing overall operational costs for the utility.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>A reconfiguração da rede ótima visa aumentar a disponibilidade
 da rede e otimizar o seu funcionamento, melhorando os perfis de tensão e
 reduzindo as perdas de potência. Porém, isso pode prejudicar o 
desempenho do sistema de proteção, e por isso, deve-se adaptar às 
alterações causadas pela reconfiguração. Desta forma, o presente 
trabalho propõe uma metodologia de proteção adaptativa para determinar 
os grupos de ajustes dos relés de sobrecorrente para cada topologia e 
com a possibilidade de modificar seus ajustes de acordo com as variações
 da rede durante a operação da rede. Para isso, as topologias radiais 
são obtidas através da operação de abertura e fechamento de chaves. 
Essas topologias pertencerão a um grupo, e cada um desses terá um 
conjunto de ajustes calculados utilizando apenas uma topologia de 
referência. Os valores do Time Multiplier Setting (TMS) e da Pickup 
Current (PC) dos relés de sobrecorrente são calculados usando o 
algoritmo de Otimização pelo Enxame de Partículas Evolucionária 
Diferencial (do inglês DEPSO) modificado neste trabalho. Como resultado,
 é possível reduzir o número de ajustes necessários para manter a 
seletividade e a coordenação do sistema de proteção. Além disso, essas 
configurações são aplicadas durante a operação do sistema de acordo com 
as alterações na corrente de operação e nos pares de relés primário e de
 backup. Os Sistemas de Distribuição IEEE de 34 e 123 barras e o Sistema
 de Teste PNNL de 329 barras adicionando Geração Distribuída (GD) foram 
utilizados para avaliar os resultados utilizando o software Open 
Distribution System Simulator (OpenDSS).</td>

						<td>To facilitate the implementation of distributed energy 
resource management systems (DERMS), we propose to insert a grid-edge 
distributed energy resource (DER) chip hosting a DERMS algorithm into 
the next generation of smart meters. This will create a pathway for the 
wide adoption of DERMS technology because many utilities plan to invest 
in advanced metering infrastructure in the near future. This will also 
bridge the gap between an electrical power utility and DERs behind the 
meter. The DER chip is designed to follow power direction signals from 
the DERMS coordinator while balancing its local objectives. We tested 
the chip using a controller- and power-hardware-in-the-loop evaluation 
under three scenarios that a DERMS could face in the real world. The DER
 chip was capable of and effective at directing four heterogeneous DERs 
to respond to a DERMS coordinator for grid services (e.g., voltage 
regulation and a virtual power plant).</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Power quality (PQ) issues are direct consequences of 
integrating power electronics components and non-linear loads into 
microgrids. These issues can also be triggered by an unbalanced loading 
in the microgrid. Certainly, they affect the daily operation scheduling 
of the microgrid. This paper proposes an optimal harmonic power flow 
(OHPF) framework for the daily optimal scheduling of a grid-connected 
microgrid, which is constructed by combining the optimization 
formulation and harmonic power flow (HPF). Within the framework, PQ is 
evaluated by observing three indices including voltage magnitude, 
voltage total harmonic distortion (THDV), and voltage unbalance factor 
(VUF). A non-iterative mitigation scheme based on demand side management
 (DSM) is proposed to avoid PQ indices violations and is integrated into
 the optimization formulation part of the OHPF as a set of load 
constraints. The proposed constraints allow a flexible combination of 
different DSM actions including load shedding and interphase load 
transfer (ILT). Furthermore, the constraints to limit voltage magnitude,
 voltage THD, and VUF are integrated into the formulation in the form of
 penalty functions. The software implementation of the proposed OHPF 
involves Julia-based JuMP.jl and Gurobi solver for optimization part and
 OpenDSS for harmonic load flow part. The effectiveness of the proposed 
framework is tested using a modified IEEE 37-bus feeder for different 
load fluctuations, which allow different combinations of PQ indices 
violations. The assessment involves both normal and intentional 
islanding conditions. The results demonstrate that, under different 
random events, the proposed framework can avoid the violation of PQ 
indices limits in most cases without adding an excessive computational 
burden to the original optimization and harmonic load flow algorithms.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The rapid expansion of consumer distributed energy resources 
(DERs) such as solar photovoltaic generation in low-voltage distribution
 grids in Australia presents new challenges to network operation, such 
as voltage imbalances and over-voltage issues. To manage large numbers 
of DERs Distributed Network Service Providers (DNSPs) are adopting 
dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs), which specify a time-varying 
permissible capacity range for DER operation within the network 
operational constraints. However, the computation of these DOEs is 
complex and existing algorithms for calculating DOEs require high levels
 of network visibility that can be expensive to acquire at the 
large-scales of typical distribution grids. To overcome these 
difficulties, this paper investigates in comparative numerical 
simulation studies a power flow based decentralised algorithm that 
adapts the additive increase multiplicative decrease (AIMD) congestion 
control algorithm used in transmission control protocols to calculate 
DOEs distinctly for each partition of the network. The proposed 
algorithm presents several appealing features, including guaranteed 
voltage violation avoidance, fast calculation of localised DOEs, 
practical scalability for large networks, and increased total power 
export to the network.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper proposes an online data-driven distributed energy 
resource management system (DERMS) optimization method using 
chance-constrained formulation to address distribution system voltage 
regulation. This is achieved via the local sensitivity factor 
(LSF)-enabled reformulation of the DER control into a linear programming
 (LP) problem, which is easy and computationally efficient to solve. The
 LSF is estimated using online measurements and does not need the 
assumption of node load information. The latter is usually required for 
existing optimization-based methods but is difficult to obtain in 
practice. To mitigate measurement uncertainties, a scenario-based 
chance-constrained formulation is constructed. Compared with other 
control methods, the results carried out in a realistic distribution 
system show that the proposed method can effectively eliminate voltage 
violation issues.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Um dos meios para compreensão dos fenômenos que envolvem o funcionamento de um
Sistema Elétrico de Potência é simular situações em ambientes computacionais que re-
produzam os comportamentos reais dos elementos que o compõe. Contudo, maioria dos
softwares para estudos no sistema elétrico de potência são produtos comerciais obtidos
por meio de licenças com um alto custo de aquisição. Desta forma, os softwares livres
surgem como uma alternativa, pois em sua filosofia promovem as liberdades de ser utili-
zado, estudado, modificado e disponibilizado, tornando-se assim de suma importância na
universidade e nas empresas do setor de energia. Este trabalho realizou uma vasta revisão
de literatura e fundamentação teórica sobre desenvolvimento de software livre, buscando
reunir conceitos dessa filosofia aos já tradicionais métodos de desenvolvimento e partir
disso, foi desenvolvido um software livre voltado para estudos de sistemas elétricos de
potência em Python, utilizando o Framework PyQt5, usando a metodologia orientada a
objetos, fazendo do software uma plataforma funcional e promissora para futuros desen-
volvimentos.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Due to the increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) and 
the need for faster charging, EVs fast charging stations (FCSs) has been
 spreading throughout the electric grid and can cause technical impacts 
in the electric distribution system due to the power withdraw of up to 
350 kW. With that in mind, this paper assesses the FCSs capacity to 
regulate voltage through local dynamic reactive power compensation. The 
impacts caused by the operation of FCSs as dynamic reactive power 
compensators (DRPCs) are studied in a real electric distribution grid 
with time-series power flow (OpenDSS) together with Python routines. 
Additionally, the Monte Carlo method is used to model the FCSs load 
curve and its locations stochastically. At the end of this work, it was 
found that the operation of FCSs as DRPCs can improve voltage profiles 
and the power factor at the substation, while reduce technical energy 
losses.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Due to the increasing penetration of distributed energy 
resources, congestion problems are already emerging in Dutch 
distribution grids. The available flexibility of assets in the built 
environment could have the potential to reduce congestion if prosumers 
are properly incentivized by distribution grid operators (DSOs). 
However, it is not yet clear what (combinations of) flexibility a 
ctivation mechanisms will be effective for congestion management in 
Dutch Distribution grids. To shed light on this issue, the GO-e 
consortium aims at performing large-scale agent-based simulations of up 
to 120 low-voltage networks and a large variety of possible instruments 
and scenarios. For this reason, we developed a novel scalable 
time-discrete simulation framework for distributed agent-based 
simulations of energy systems. We demonstrate the framework on a 
case-study in which we assess the effectiveness of a dynamic bandwidth 
tariff instrument on overloading problems in a low-voltage network 
containing solar panels, batteries, and heat pumps. It was shown that a 
dynamic bandwidth tariff can successfully resolve forecasted congestion 
if the associated costs are high enough compared to the day-ahead 
prices. However, the resulting load shifting can cause new congestion 
intra-day aswell.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>With the growth of distribution systems and the stress it 
entails on network components, there has recently been an increasing 
concern with their integrity. In particular, Distribution System 
Operators (DSOs) show special concern regarding faults that could 
potentially prove hazardous towards citizens. In particular, High 
Voltage (HV) Line Down faults occur when an overhead line on the HV 
network falls to the ground, losing supply from the HV side but 
remaining live from the Low Voltage (LV) side. These faults are 
extremely hazardous and life-threatening to both people and wildlife. 
Moreover, this kind of event destabilises the voltages on the LV side, 
which fall to levels far below their rating and that may be too low to 
ensure quality of supply to customers. This paper presents the Eneida 
DeepGrid® HV Line Down fault detection method and its performance under 
various scenarios. Results show that this method is able to correctly 
detect and pinpoint faults, as well as identify the faulty phase.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>As the penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into
 distribution systems increases, so does the interest in forecasting 
relevant system variables to help mitigate the associated challenges. 
One such challenge is the more frequent occurrence of excessive voltages
 in distribution systems with higher shares of DERs. Accurate and 
reliable estimates together with forecasts of system states (i.e., nodal
 voltages) will therefore play a key role in improving the utilization 
of these variable and uncertain sources while mitigating potential 
operational risks. Whilst recent literature has explored machine 
learning (ML) methods for voltage estimation and their extrapolation for
 a short-time period into the future, few have taken uncertainty 
quantification into account, and these methods have not yet been 
translated into operations. This paper discusses the advantages offered 
by probabilistic voltage forecasts and proposes a non-parametric 
Bayesian method suitable for forecasting nodal voltages at short-term 
time horizons while accounting for uncertainties in load and distributed
 photovoltaic (PV) generation. We demonstrate the value of the proposed 
Gaussian process (GP) model for a case study using historical forecasts 
and observation data.</td>

						<td>In recent years, the Large Language Models have developed at

status and potential use of ChatGPT, (ready-to-use) pretrained chatbot, 
to create test distribution systems modeled as DSS files for load flow 
studies using OpenDSS, focusing on educational purposes. A performance 
comparison of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 large language models (with the ChatGPT 
frontend) has been conducted. More specifically, the ability of ChatGPT 
to generate simple test circuits to run in OpenDSS is verified, 
including elements such as lines, loads, transformers, and photovoltaic 
generators. The ability of ChatGPT to identify and solve simple 
engineering problems applied to the generated circuits is also briefly 
discussed. The results demonstrate that GPT-4 has the potential to 
support educational activities by creating functional circuits and 
propose solutions for engineering problems if adequate guidance and 
examples are provided.</td>

						<td>Abstract
          Self-healing "smart grids" are characterized by fast-acting, 
intelligent control mechanisms that minimize power disruptions during 
outages. The corrective actions adopted during outages in power 
distribution networks include reconfiguration through switching control 
and emergency load shedding. The conventional decision-making models for
 outage mitigation are, however, not suitable for "smart grids" due to 
their slow response and computational inefficiency. Here, we present a 
new reinforcement learning (RL) model for outage management in the 
distribution network to enhance its resilience. The distinctive 
characteristic of our approach is that it explicitly accounts for the 
underlying network topology and its variations with switching control, 
while also capturing the complex interdependencies between state 
variables (along nodes and edges) by modeling the task as a graph 
learning problem. Our model learns the  optimal control policy for power
 restoration using a Capsule-based graph neural network. We validate our
 model on two test networks, namely the 13 and 34-bus modified IEEE 
networks where it is shown to achieve near-optimal, real-time 
performance with up to 5 orders of magnitude improvement in 
computational speed. The resilience improvement of our model in terms of
 loss of energy is 4.204 MWs and 13.522 MWs for 13 and 34 buses, 
respectively. Our model also demonstrates generalizability across a 
broad range of outage scenarios.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The growth of distributed generation and the need of 
increasing Distribution Network (DN) resilience is encouraging 
Distribution System Operators (DSO) to increase awareness about the 
real-time status of the network as well as to actively manage flexible 
energy resources for improving system performances. In this context, 
Digital Twin (DT) is an enabling technology for a low-cost distributed 
framework that supports DN management. DT in the power system can be 
exploited taking advantage of the successful experiences in other 
sectors (e.g., smart manufacturing and building automation). This 
article presents a real case study of a DT development and its 
integration with an existing DN. The DT system architecture is based on 
the recent standards whilst main DT components have been originally 
developed, enabling near real-time services such as data collection, 
state estimation, and flexibility calculator. The individual 
performances of the integrated tools and the reliability of DT were 
tested and validated during one month of continuous operation. During 
the operation, good service continuity and accuracy performances were 
reported. Results from the flexibility calculator show the effectiveness
 of the proposed strategies that can improve the energy efficiency of 
the DN by increasing local self-consumption of Renewable Energy Sources 
(RES) production.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The present work was produced concurrently with the extension project entitled "System for
Detecting Non-Technical Losses in Irrigation Areas Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques"
and aims to determine non-technical losses of electrical energy in distribution systems using
the energy balance methodology. Energy losses are quantified by type, which can be technical
or non-technical (commercial) losses, and both together represent the overall losses of the
system. Overall losses can be calculated based on the difference between the energy supplied
by the utility company and the energy demanded by consumer units (UCs). Technical losses
are inherent in the processes of generation, transmission, and energy conversion throughout the
system, with Joule's Effect being one of the most well-known examples. On the other hand,
non-technical losses refer to energy that was consumed but not billed by the supplying
company. Therefore, to estimate the value of non-technical losses in the distribution system,
based on the energy balance, real consumption and supply data, as well as information on the
electrical networks provided by the CPFL Energia Group, were used. The Python language was
used to automate a tool capable of performing the energy balance using the input data provided
by the utility company. The employed methodology provides as output data the overall,
technical, and non-technical losses of the analyzed distribution systems and identifies feeders
with possible irregular consumer units. Once regions or feeders prone to non-conformities are
identified, it facilitates the energy company in taking actions to minimize non-technical losses
in the distribution electrical networks.</td>

						<td>The growing integration of distributed solar photovoltaic (PV)
 in distribution systems could result in adverse effects during grid 
operation. This paper develops a two-agent soft actor critic-based deep 
reinforcement learning (SAC-DRL) solution to simultaneously control PV 
inverters and battery energy storage systems for voltage regulation and 
peak demand reduction. The novel two-stage framework, featured with two 
different control agents, is applied for daytime and nighttime 
operations to enhance control performance. Comparison results with other
 control methods on a real feeder in Western Colorado demonstrate that 
the proposed method can provide advanced voltage regulation with modest 
active power curtailment and reduce peak load demand from feeder’s head.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Recently, numerous data-driven approaches to control an 
electric grid using machine learning techniques have been investigated. 
Reinforcement learning (RL)-based techniques provide a credible 
alternative to conventional, optimization-based solvers especially when 
there is uncertainty in the environment, such as renewable generation or
 cyber system performance. Efficiently training an agent, however, 
requires numerous interactions with an environment to learn the best 
policies. There are numerous RL environments for power systems, and, 
similarly, there are environments for communication systems. Most cyber 
system simulators are based in a UNIX environment, while the power 
system simulators are based in the Windows operating system. Hence the 
generation of a cyber-physical, mixed-domain RL environment has been 
challenging. Existing co-simulation methods are efficient, but are 
resource and time intensive to generate large-scale data sets for 
training RL agents. Hence, this work focuses on the development and 
validation of a mixed-domain RL environment using OpenDSS for the power 
system and leveraging a discrete event simulator Python package, SimPy 
for the cyber system, which is operating system agnostic. Further, we 
present the results of co-simulation and training RL agents for a 
cyber-physical network reconfiguration and Volt-Var control problem in a
 power distribution feeder.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The massive and widespread rooftop photovoltaic penetration 
poses new challenges to Distribution System Operators who may need to 
deal with over and undervoltage problems in the same feeder. To tackle 
this issue, this work proposes to use the smart inverters from 
photovoltaic systems to compensate, in real-time, the exact amount of 
reactive power demanded by the customers to which they are connected. 
The proposed strategy does not require expensive and complex 
communication infrastructure, active power curtailment, or inverters 
over­ sizing. With a simple infrastructure, it decreases energy losses 
and the need for capacitor banks. Time-series power-flow simulations are
 performed in a real distribution system. The results indicate that the 
proposed strategy of var compensation mitigates more energy losses and 
voltage transgression than for the cases in which the smart inverters 
operate with unity power factor, Volt-Watt, or Volt-var control rules.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Cyber infrastructures have been extensively used for power 
system monitoring, control, and operation because of the development of 
new information and communications technology (ICT) in power systems. 
Deployment of cyber-physical co-simulation in the case of a realistic 
distribution network is still a big challenge. Hence, to solve the 
problem of modelling complex distribution networks, a cyber-physical 
co-simulation framework is proposed in this chapter. The proposed 
framework consists of a cybernetic layer, a physical layer, and a 
co-simulation framework between OpenDSS and Typhoon HIL. The cyber layer
 consists of software and tools to model the distribution system and 
communicate with the physical layer. The physical layer is the Typhoon 
HIL real-time simulator consisting of virtual or real controllable 
devices. A realistic framework to execute the real-time simulation using
 the Typhoon HIL SCADA system and Python-based co-simulation is created 
in this chapter. The real-time simulation demonstrates the proposed 
framework’s effectiveness in observing the distribution network’s 
voltage profile due to real-time variation in reactive power from the 
PV.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>There has been a significant growth in the distributed energy 
resources (DERs) connected to the distribution networks in recent years.
 For a distribution system with a high penetration of DERs, a detailed 
modeling and representation of the distribution network is needed to 
accurately assess its steady-state and dynamic behavior.
In this dissertation, a field-validated model for a real 
sub-transmission and distribution network is developed, including one of
 the feeders modeled with the secondary network and loads and solar PV 
units at their household/user location. A procedure is developed 
combining data from various sources such as the utility database, 
geoinformation data, and field measurements to create an accurate 
network model.
Applying a single line to ground fault to the detailed distribution 
feeder model, a high voltage swell, with potentially detrimental impacts
 on connected equipment, is shown in one of the non-faulted phases of 
the feeder. The reason for this voltage swell is analyzed in detail. It 
is found that with appropriate control the solar PV units on the feeder 
can reduce the severity of the voltage swell, but not entirely eliminate
 it.
For integrated studies of the transmission-distribution (T&amp;D) 
network, a T&amp;D co-simulation framework is developed, which is 
capable of power flow as well as dynamic simulations, and supports 
unbalanced modeling and disturbances in the distribution as well as the 
sub-transmission system. The power flow co-simulation framework is 
developed as a module that can be run on a cloud-based platform.
Using the developed framework, the T&amp;D system response is studied 
for balanced and unbalanced faults on the distribution and 
sub-transmission system. For some faults the resultant loss of 
generation can potentially lead to the entire feeder tripping due to 
high unbalance at the substation. However, it is found that advanced 
inverter controls may improve the response of the distribution feeders 
to the faults. The dissertation also highlights the importance of 
modeling the secondary network for both steady-state and dynamic 
studies. Lastly, a preliminary investigation is conducted to include 
different dynamic elements such as grid-forming inverters in a T&amp;D 
network simulation.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>With the increasing amount of distributed energy resources 
(DERs) integration, there is a signiﬁcant need to model and analyze 
hosting capacity (HC) for future electric distribution grids. Hosting 
capacity analysis (HCA) examines the amount of DERs that can be safely 
integrated into the grid and is a challenging task in full generality 
because there are many possible integration of DERs in foresight. That 
is, there are numerous extreme points between feasible and infeasible 
sets. Moreover, HC depends on multiple factors such as (a) adoption 
patterns of DERs that depend on socio-economic behaviors and (b) how 
DERs are controlled and managed. These two factors are intrinsic to the 
problem space because not all integration of DERs may be centrally 
planned, and could largely change our understanding about HC. This paper
 addresses the research gap by capturing the two factors (a) and (b) in 
HCA and by identifying a few most insightful HC scenarios at the cost of
 domain knowledge. We propose a data-driven HCA framework and introduce 
active learning in HCA to effectively explore scenarios. Active learning
 in HCA and characteristics of HC with respect to the two factors (a) 
and (b) are illustrated in a 3-bus example. Next, detailed largescale 
studies are proposed to understand the signiﬁcance of (a) and (b). Our 
ﬁndings suggest that HC and its interpretations signiﬁcantly change 
subject to the two factors (a) and (b).</td>

 conceived as a system of nonlinear equalities solved by Newton’s method

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This work proposes positive- and negative-sequence equivalent 
circuits of grid-forming inverters for steady-state analysis. The 
proposed models are especially attractive for performing long-duration 
voltage regulation analysis and short-circuit studies involving 
grid-forming inverters. Our proposed equivalent circuit models are based
 on the inverter’s voltage and current control loops in the \alpha \beta
 and dq frames. For this reason, they operate according to prescribed 
control functions and specified impedances (i.e., filter impedance, 
current limiter block, virtual admittance block, and PI/PR controller 
block). The equivalent circuit model accuracy is validated by comparing 
system steady-state voltage and current responses obtained by detailed 
time-domain models in PSCAD/EMTDC to those by the equivalent circuit 
models implemented in steady-state load flow program (e.g., OpenDSS). 
Two distinct control structures implemented in the \alpha \beta and dq 
frames are used for the validation. Single line-to-ground and 
line-to-line-to-ground faults are simulated in a small islanded 
microgrid as well as the IEEE 34-node test feeder. Fault impedances 
varying from 0 to 5 ohms are simulated. We show that the equivalent 
models precisely replicate the steady-state response of the detailed 
time-domain models.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>With more and more applications of distributed energy 
resources powered by renewable energy in distribution power systems, 
there is an increasing need to improve power system’s resiliency for 
reliable and continuous power supply and efficiency while reducing 
carbon emissions. To reach this target, we investigate the path to study
 distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution systems from 
planning, real-time operation and control, restoration and 
reconfiguration after faults. First, we introduce metrics of microgrid 
performance and use these metrics in DERs planning and storage analysis 
with testing of battery model to evaluate transient stability and mode 
transition. The metrics are used in the following chapters to evaluate 
power loss, voltage deviation in Volt-VAR control, and operational 
complexity in restoration. The combination of distribution system and 
DERs modeling are used to validate clustering method for size and site 
solutions for distributed generation using time series simulation. 
Furthermore, sizing and siting of DERs in a distribution system has been
 studied to intentionally form multiple self-sufficient microgrids to 
increase resiliency. However, DER planning is not adequate for real-time
 operations and avoiding voltage violations caused by intermittent power
 generation from photovoltaic sources. Thus, our second contribution is a
 localized model-free Volt-VAR optimization (VVO) approach for network 
power loss minimization. The proposed controller is a combination of the
 extremum seeking algorithm to achieve the network-level objective 
without communications with other decision-making agents and an adaptive
 droop controller to achieve a stable response under fast varying 
phenomena. We also evaluate the theoretical conditions for localized 
results to approach to centralized optimal solutions. Finally, we 
implement deep Q learning (DQN) in load restoration using switch 
operations for random fault scenarios. To evaluate the capability of the
 DQN model, we build OpenAI gym compatible environment integrating 
OpenDSS, tune learning rate and hidden layers configuration of neural 
network, and make predictions using trained model. These results show 
that the DQN provides decisions perform close to human experience 
results with only partial measurements and status of the system. These 
three contributions include DERs planning, volt-VAR optimization and 
control, and load restoration in distribution power systems.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper proposes a distributed energy resource management 
system (DERMS) solution by developing a new voltage sensitivity enabled 
feedback optimization framework. The key idea is to adopt a measurement 
feedback scheme to reformulate the original nonlinear optimization into a
 linear programming (LP) problem via perturb and observe-based voltage 
sensitivity analysis. The proposed solution eliminates the dependence on
 load knowledge and can be implemented online thanks to an efficient 
open-source solver for LP problems. The proposed DERMS online platform 
is generalizable to deal with various types of distributed energy 
resources (DERs), including distributed photovoltaics (PVs), energy 
storage, electric vehicles, demand response, etc. Comparison results 
with other control methods on a realistic distribution feeder in 
Southern California highlight the feasibility as well as benefits for 
the proposed framework.</td>

 often assessed with an individual technology focus. Similarly, 
different technology offices often leverage different sets of tools, 
leading to analyses that are not comparable. EERE sought the ability to 
assess the impact of integrating multiple DER technologies, and to 
comprehensively address DER integration challenges across the portfolio 
of EERE technologies. This project built on existing work understanding

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Due to the increased installation of rooftop PV generators in 
electric power distribution systems and the intrinsic uncertainties, 
impact studies require probabilistic methods such as Monte Carlo 
simulation. An important uncertainty of the Monte Carlo simulation 
involving rooftop PV systems is the local of installation. Considering 
all the customer units from the utility database with equal probability 
for receiving a rooftop PV generator provides unrealistic results. For 
instance, customers of a building should not receive the same treatment 
as houses. In this context, to allow more realistic studies, this work 
presents a methodology for selecting the most probable customer units to
 install rooftop PV generators considering net metering tariff. The 
methodology consists of reading a real complete database of a 
distribution utility, sizing the rooftop PV generators, filtering the 
customer units with the highest potential to receive a PV generator, and
 creating the scenarios for the Monte Carlo study. At the end, 
computational simulations using OpenDSS are carried out in two real 
distribution networks to illustrate the application of the method.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This work proposes a generic method to utilize customer smart 
meter measurements to automatically and simultaneously estimate 
topology, line parameters, and customer and line phasing connections in 
low voltage (LV) distribution systems. This generic approach is 
applicable to single, two, and three-phases lines and customers. Hence, 
it is suitable not only for North American systems but also for European
 and South American systems. This generic estimation is conducted by 
using a multiple linear regression model applied to data supplied by 
customers meters. The acceptance of each estimated parameter is carried 
out through comparisons with mathematical (e.g., coefficient of 
determination and relative standard deviation) and physical constraints 
(e.g., resistances, line length, and conductor X/R ratios). Granularity 
and sensitivity analyses are also conducted taking into account smart 
meter data quality (e.g., update ratio, metering errors, resolution, 
clock desynchronization). The obtained results show the high performance
 of the method to correctly estimate the system topology, line 
parameters, and line and customers phasing based on a specification of 
15-day sample size with 60-min resolution as a general compromise 
solution between data acquisition and accuracy.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The growing adoption of Distributed Energy Re-sources (DER) in
 low-voltage distribution grids calls for new feedback control 
algorithms that rely on quasi-real-time data collected by remote 
sensors. The design and evaluation of such algorithms necessitates a 
prudent and comprehensive approach since these algorithms require a 
tight integration of power and communication systems. A simple link 
failure or a sophisticated cyberattack launched against the grid's 
monitoring, communication, and control infrastructure could rapidly grow
 out of control, making the grid unstable. We investigate the design and
 implementation of a high-fidelity smart grid simulation platform which 
integrates a network simulator and a power flow simulator using the 
Mosaik co-simulation framework. The platform allows for evaluating the 
performance of new control algorithms and understanding dynamics of 
modern distribution grids. Example case studies are presented to 
validate the proposed platform.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This work describes the Grid-Enhanced, Mobility-Integrated 
Network Infrastructures for Extreme Fast Charging (GEMINI) architecture 
for the co-simulation of distribution and transportation systems to 
evaluate EV charging impacts on electric distribution systems of a large
 metropolitan area and the surrounding rural regions with high ﬁdelity. 
The current co-simulation is applied to Oakland and Alameda, California,
 and in future work will be extended to the full San Francisco Bay Area.
 It uses the HELICS co-simulation framework to enable parallel instances
 of vetted grid and transportation software programs to interact at 
every model timestep, allowing high-ﬁdelity simulations at a large 
scale. This enables not only the impacts of electriﬁed transportation 
systems across a larger interconnected collection of distribution 
feeders to be evaluated, but also the feedbacks between the two systems,
 such as through control systems, to be captured and compared. The 
ﬁndings are that with moderate passenger EV adoption rates, inverter 
controls combined with some distribution system hardware upgrades can 
maintain grid voltages within ANSI C.84 range A limits of 0.95 to 1.05 
p.u. without smart charging. However, EV charging control may be 
required for higher levels of charging or to reduce grid upgrades, and 
this will be explored in future work.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Most recently, stochastic control methods such as deep 
reinforcement learning (DRL) have proven to be efficient and quick 
converging methods in providing localized grid voltage control. Because 
of the random dynamical characteristics of grid reactive loads and bus 
voltages, such stochastic control methods are particularly useful in 
accurately predicting future voltage levels and in minimizing associated
 cost functions. Although DRL is capable of quickly inferring future 
voltage levels given specific voltage control actions, it is prone to 
high variance when the learning rate or discount factors are set for 
rapid convergence in the presence of bus noise. Evolutionary learning is
 also capable of minimizing cost function and can be leveraged for 
localized grid control, but it does not infer future voltage levels 
given specific control inputs and instead simply selects those control 
actions that result in the best voltage control. For this reason, 
evolutionary learning is better suited than DRL for voltage control in 
noisy grid environments. To illustrate this, using a cyber adversary to 
inject random noise, we compare the use of evolutionary learning and DRL
 in autonomous voltage control (AVC) under noisy control conditions and 
show that it is possible to achieve a high mean voltage control using a 
genetic algorithm (GA). We show that the GA additionally can provide 
superior AVC to DRL with comparable computational efficiency. We 
illustrate that the superior noise immunity properties of evolutionary 
learning make it a good choice for implementing AVC in noisy 
environments or in the presence of random cyber-attacks.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Nowadays, the deployment of smart meters is increasing 
worldwide. The information provided by this equipment allows vast 
improvements to grid management. Among the potential applications, the 
mitigation of non-technical losses is an important benefit for the 
utilities and the customers. High levels of unknown consumption 
deteriorate the system operation and increase its costs. Usually, part 
of the non-technical losses costs is assigned to the customers, and part
 to the utilities, representing revenue loss and high-energy tariffs. In
 this scenario, this work investigates the application of smart meters 
measurements to detect and locate non-technical losses in low voltage 
systems. The proposed methodology is based on the coefficient of 
determination evaluation obtained from a multiple linear regression 
model of the circuit. The study cases show that the method can 
successfully detect and locate non-technical losses. However, factors as
 measurements accuracy, resolution, update ratio, desynchronization, and
 the amount of deviated power affect its performance.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The massive growth of photovoltaic (PV) generators connected 
to low voltage (LV) systems is making it impractical for utilities to 
conduct a detailed technical analysis to approve every connection 
request. In response, this paper proposes simple equations to quickly 
estimate the PV hosting capacity on any circuit location without the 
need to run power flow simulations. By representing all loads and 
generators as constant current consumption/injection, the superposition 
theorem can be used to calculate the impact of each new PV on voltage 
magnitude and current flows. This approach can be used on a first 
screening assessment to immediately filter out cases that present no 
risk of technical violations to the circuit. Only connection requests 
flagged with risk of violation in this initial screening must be 
analyzed in detail by specialized engineers. Any type of PV connection 
(single-phase, two-phase, three-phase) in unbalanced multiphase LV 
systems can be analyzed. Extensive validation studies reveal that this 
approach is conservative, which makes it safe and reliable for quick 
first screening analyses. Its estimation errors are between 5% and 18%. 
Recommendations on how to employ the proposed approach in practice are 
also presented.</td>

						<td>The increased penetration of rooftop PV generators in electric
 power distribution networks has caused technical problems, such as 
overvoltage, low power factor, and higher maintenance costs of Volt-var 
control equipment. This work investigates the potential of modern 
Volt-var control technologies in mitigating technical issues aggravated 
by the connection of rooftop PV generators to the distribution systems. 
The performance of the technologies is assessed in terms of the 
violation of steady-state voltage and power factor regulatory limits, 
and the number of operations of controllable devices, which affects 
maintenance costs. Active power loss is also evaluated to identify how 
the technology under analysis affects it. The results can be used to 
guide the utilities in the choice of the most suitable solution (a 
single or a set of equipment) according to the identified technical 
problems.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>An important power quality concern of integrating single-phase
 photovoltaic (PV) generators to low-voltage (LV) residential systems, 
is their impact on harmonic distortions due to their power 
electronic-based interface through a voltage source converter (VSC). 
Unfortunately, most existing single-phase PV models are focused on the 
analysis of an individual device, and do not provide a modular circuit 
model that can be directly integrated into a commercial harmonic power 
flow simulation tool for large-scale power system studies. In response, 
this paper derives a single-input single-output harmonic model for 
single-phase PVs that is independent of grid parameters, thus enabling 
multiple of these devices to be considered simultaneously in system-wide
 harmonic power flow analyses. The model is validated with 
electromagnetic transient simulations and then, characterization studies
 are conducted to determine the expected harmonic impact of these PV 
generators on a real LV system. Results demonstrate these devices can 
increase system damping at typical low order harmonics and are unlikely 
to introduce new resonances at this frequency range. In addition, it is 
essential to model the VSC controller effect for a more accurate 
assessment of its harmonic impact. Sensitivity studies reveal how 
different VSC parameters affect this behavior.</td>

						<td>Distribution systems will require new cost-effective solutions
 to provide network capacity and increased flexibility to accommodate 
Low Carbon Technologies. To address this need, we propose the Hybrid 
Multi-Terminal Soft Open Point (Hybrid MT-SOP) to efficiently provide 
distribution system interconnection capacity. Each leg of the Hybrid 
MT-SOP has an AC/DC converter connected in series with a bank of AC 
switches (Feeder Selector Switches) to allow the converter to connect to
 any of the feeders at a node. Asymmetric converter sizing is shown to 
increase feasible power transfers by up to 50% in the three-terminal 
case, whilst a conic mixed-integer program is formulated to optimally 
select the device configuration and power transfers. A case study shows 
the Hybrid MT-SOP increasing utilization of the converters by more than 
one third, with a 13% increase in system loss reduction as compared to 
an equally-sized MT-SOP.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In this work, we introduce Log(v) 3LPF, a linear power flow 
solver for unbalanced three-phase distribution systems. Log(v) 3LPF uses
 a logarithmic transform of the voltage phasor to linearize the AC power
 flow equations around the balanced case. We incorporate the modeling of
 ZIP loads, transformers, capacitor banks, switches and their 
corresponding controls and express the network equations in 
matrix-vector form. With scalability in mind, special attention is given
 to the computation of the inverse of the system admittance matrix, 
Ybus. We use the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury identity for an efficient 
computation of the inverse of a rank-k corrected matrix and compare the 
performance of this method with traditional LU decomposition methods 
using Big-$\mathcal O$ notation. We showcase the solver for a variety of
 network sizes, ranging from tens to thousands of nodes, and compare the
 Log(v) 3LPF with commercial-grade software, such as OpenDSS.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Utilizing distributed renewable and energy storage resources 
via peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading has long been touted as a solution
 to improve energy system's resilience and sustainability. Consumers and
 prosumers (those who have energy generation resources), however, do not
 have expertise to engage in repeated P2P trading, and the zero-marginal
 costs of renewables present challenges in determining fair market 
prices. To address these issues, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement 
learning (MARL) framework to help automate consumers' bidding and 
management of their solar PV and energy storage resources, under a 
specific P2P clearing mechanism that utilizes the so-called 
supply-demand ratio. In addition, we show how the MARL framework can 
integrate physical network constraints to realize decentralized voltage 
control, hence ensuring physical feasibility of the P2P energy trading 
and paving ways for real-world implementations.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The City of Los Angeles has set ambitious goals to transform 
its electricity supply, aiming to achieve a 100% renewable energy power 
system by 2045, along with aggressive electrification targets for 
buildings and vehicles. To reach these goals, and assess the 
implications for jobs, electricity rates, the environment, and 
environmental justice, the Los Angeles City Council passed a series of 
motions directing the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) 
to determine the technical feasibility and investment pathways of a 100%
 renewable energy portfolio standard. The Los Angeles 100% Renewable 
Energy Study (LA100) is a first-of-its-kind objective, rigorous, and 
science-based power systems analysis to determine what investments could
 be made to achieve these goals. The LA100 final report is presented as a
 collection of 12 chapters and an executive summary, each of which is 
available as an individual download. This chapter summarizes the growth 
in distribution-connected energy resources and provides a detailed 
review of impacts to the distribution grid of growth in customer 
electricity demand, solar, and storage, as well as required distribution
 grid upgrades and associated costs.</td>

<div><p>In the residential sector, there is considerable growth in 
smart, interactive devices including thermostats, water heaters, 
electric vehicle chargers, solar panels, and battery systems. These 
devices can all provide the electric grid with additional flexibility, 
which is a valuable resource for grid operators and helps reduce system 
costs and emissions. However, it is difficult to control these devices 
because there is considerable diversity in the residential housing stock
 and because the controls depend on stochastic variables such as weather
 and occupant behavior. We present a stochastic control framework for 
home energy management systems that can control these devices while 
accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty. To do this, we first 
develop an integrated residential energy model that can simulate 
multiple controllable devices with high resolution and can interface 
with external controllers. We then design a control framework with a 
linear residential energy model, a forecast generator that provides 
realistic estimates of weather and occupancy variables, and a control 
objective that captures energy costs and occupant comfort. The control 
framework is used to evaluate the performance of heuristic, 
deterministic, and stochastic control methods, primarily model 
predictive control.We show that the stochastic model predictive control 
performs best in scenarios with realistic levels of uncertainty. We also
 validate the residential energy models and show the benefits of 
high-fidelity modeling for building-to-grid co-simulation studies. The 
results shown in this dissertation provide a deeper understanding of 
residential load flexibility in uncertain conditions, and the frameworks
 developed enable future research for evaluating flexible loads in a 
broad set of applications.</p></div>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper introduces a novel approach for generating solar 
photovoltaic (PV) plant deployment scenarios for grid integration 
planning. The approach guarantees consistency among scenarios of the 
same deployment by ensuring that higher penetration scenarios contain PV
 units deployed in lower penetration scenarios. It also constrains the 
size and spatial distribution of the PV plants and considers three 
placement types. A case study on a real-world distribution system proves
 that the precepts of scenario consistency, deployment diversity, and 
placement are met. The study further investigates the impact of the 
resulting scenarios via a stochastic hosting capacity analysis. Results 
indicate that the ratio between PV and load sizes, referred to as the 
nodal PV penetration factor (NPPF), is a key driver of the grid 
integration impact. By reducing the NPPF from 5 to 2, the maximum 
hosting capacity increased by at least 112%. The study also reveals that
 scenarios under random placement can lead to higher hosting capacity 
values.</td>

			<h2>Phasor-Based Control on Islanded Networks</h2>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The advancement of sensing technologies for the power grid has allowed the development
of new strategies for the control of distributed energy resources (DERs). In particular, the
emergence of phasor measurement units (PMUs) designed for deployment at the distribution
level has presented an exciting opportunity. These PMUs have enabled the development of
phasor-based control (PBC), a strategy that formulates DER power dispatch in terms of
voltage phasor targets to be tracked by local controllers.
This dissertation focuses on the optimal power flow (OPF) component of PBC’s supervisory
control layer, which has previously been conceptualized and demonstrated in simulation on
distribution networks. We expand its applicability to medium-voltage minigrids and micro-
grids operating in island mode, networks where PBC has the potential to deliver important
benefits.
The work is carried out in two stages. After a discussion of PBC and other relevant back-
ground topics, we address one of the primary challenges to PBC at the medium voltage level:
the need for extreme accuracy in the supervisory controller’s generation of phasor targets.
This accuracy is achieved through an adaptation of an iterative OPF methodology that re-
fines a linearized model of power flow through successive exchanges with a nonlinear solver.
We discuss the changes that were made to both linear model and nonlinear solver, as well
as the determination of phasor targets on networks that include tap-changing transformers
and other realistic equipment. The accuracy of the adapted iterative method is then shown
in simulation.
The second stage of the work covers the extension of our OPF implementation to islanded
systems. We present a strategy for the treatment of the slack bus used by our nonlinear
solver and apply it to several test cases in simulation. We then analyze a specific case in
2
which our iterative solution method fails, and demonstrate the use of a penalty factor in
our linearized OPF formulation as a means of overcoming that failure. A full, end-to-end
implementation of PBC’s supervisory layer is then proposed and tested on a number of DER
distributions at different feeder penetration levels.
We end with a presentation of data relevant to instrument-transformer-induced error in PMU
measurements. This final portion stands alone from the primary work of the dissertation, but
remains highly relevant to PBC. From an experimental deployment of two PMUs measuring
an identical distribution-grid voltage, we determine a ratio of the errors induced by their
individual potential transformers. Monitoring this quantity over the course of a year allows us
to track the drift in those induced errors over time, motivating a discussion of the expected
impact of error drift on PBC and the frequency with which transformers will need to be
recalibrated in operational settings.</td>

			<h2>Cyber Risk Analysis and Threat Mitigation Strategies Against

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Distributed Energy Resources penetration levels continue to 
increase across distribution networks, producing a wide variety of 
challenges for system operators. Creating among others, the need for new
 or improved methods that can manage their output characteristics. This 
has led to regulatory amendments that are expected to facilitate secure 
grid operations while continuing to enable increasing levels of 
Distributed Energy Resources penetration. However, it is still unclear 
if these systems will behave as intended in the presence of a cyber 
attack.To address this fundamental question, this work presents a 
detailed cybersecurity analysis on Distributed Energy Resources and 
Internet of Things infrastructure, covering a wide variety of angles 
from assessing device-level vulnerabilities to proposing methods/metrics
 that can quantify risk at the system-level. In addition, this work 
introduces two, fully-virtualized cyber-physical testbeds that have been
 envisioned for cyber-security researchers. It is expected that these 
software-based tools can aid to develop better, more secure Internet of 
Things and Distributed Energy Resource-based deployments.Furthermore, 
methods for ensuring correct operation at the device-level and 
distribution system-level are presented. In specific, a Trusted 
Execution Environment solution, which relies on hardware-level process 
isolation has been developed to provide digital-attestation services on 
analog inputs. The final contribution of this work is the development of
 a distributed fail-safe method for managing Volt-Var operations. The 
proposed method combines local voltage information (from independent 
agents) and simplified network models to determine the expected voltage 
output before actually executing the command using consensus-voting 
techniques. The underlying distributed consensus methods and power 
models work together to ensure that a final decision not only satisfies 
traditional power system constraints such as security (correctness) and 
dependability but also availability and partition tolerance under 
distributed systems theory.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Emerging distributed energy resources (DERs)—such as solar 
photovoltaics (PV), battery energy storage systems (BESS), and electric 
vehicles (EVs)—are expected to increase substantially in India in the 
coming years following policy-driven targets of the Government of India 
to modernize its electricity system, reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
(GHGs), and improve air quality. These emerging technologies can pose 
challenges to distribution utilities, forcing overhauls in planning and 
operational practices. They can also create challenges in power system 
infrastructure planning and cause more frequent system operational 
violations (e.g., network voltage bounds and loading thresholds) if not 
properly integrated. The impacts on the localized power distribution 
grid from these emerging technologies manifest in increased 
infrastructure investments and erratic shifts in demand patterns. These 
impacts are not yet well understood, and analytic solutions are not 
readily available. To address these challenges, the National Renewable 
Energy Laboratory (NREL), in collaboration with BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd.
 (BRPL), developed an advanced power distribution system impact analysis
 framework of BRPL’s distribution system. This framework helps analyze 
the readiness of the power distribution network to accommodate emerging 
technologies and the potential opportunities they might introduce. The 
framework has been predominantly set up to evaluate distributed PV, 
BESS, and EVs. In this collaboration between NREL and BRPL, we developed
 and evaluated the framework on two distribution feeders in the BRPL 
territory for various scenarios of BESS and EVs. BESS are evaluated for 
their effectiveness on the grid to mitigate present and future feeder 
overloading scenarios, and they are subsequently analyzed for their 
costs compared to the costs of traditional upgradation measures. 
Scenarios include assessing the effects of EV density on grid 
infrastructure upgrades and interlinking EV management with BESS 
integration.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper proposes a reference framework for a transactive 
energy market based on distributed ledger technology such as blockchain.
 The framework design was based on the engineering requirements of a 
distribution-scale market, including participant needs, expected market 
transactions, and the cybersecurity constructs required to support a 
fair, secure, and efficient market operation. It leverages the existing 
blockchain attributes to provide clear value propositions that are 
applicable to transactive energy market applications. Those attributes 
are evaluated to not only facilitate the energy market mechanisms but 
also assist with the cybersecurity requirements, such as access control 
management (including identification, authentication, and 
authorization); data security and integrity; and resilience management 
(decentralization, scalability, and performance during faults). The 
validity of the proposed framework is demonstrated using a real-time, 
five-minute double-auction market. The results highlight the framework 
benefits and provide a strong validation of its applicability to 
blockchain-based transactive energy systems. The proposed design can 
help to support machine-to-machine transactions that can be directly 
integrated into complex grid operations, such as automated market 
bidding and self-sufficient, resilience-capable grids.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Local energy markets are emerging as a tool for coordinating 
generation, storage, and consumption of energy from distributed 
resources. In combination with automation, they promise to provide an 
effective energy management framework that is fair and brings 
system-level savings. The cooperative–competitive nature of energy 
markets calls for multi-agent based automation with learning energy 
trading agents. However, depending on the dynamics of the 
agent–environment interaction, this approach may yield unintended 
behavior of market participants. Thus, the design of market mechanisms 
suitable for reinforcement learning agents must take into account this 
interplay. This article introduces autonomous local energy exchange 
(ALEX) as an experimental framework that combines multi-agent learning 
and double auction mechanism. Participants determine their internal 
price signals and make energy management decisions through market 
interactions, rather than relying on predetermined external price 
signals. The main contribution of this article is examination of 
compatibility between specific market elements and independent learning 
agents. Effects of different market properties are evaluated through 
simulation experiments, and the results are used for determine a 
suitable market design. The results show that market truthfulness 
maintains demand-response functionality, while weak budget balancing 
provides a strong reinforcement signal for the learning agents. The 
resulting agent behavior is compared with two baselines: net billing and
 time-of-use rates. The ALEX-based pricing is more responsive to 
fluctuations in the community net load compared to the time-of-use. The 
more accurate accounting of renewable energy usage reduced bills by a 
median 38.8% compared to net billing, confirming the ability to better 
facilitate demand response.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>With the rise of the integration of renewable energy sources, 
the operating characteristics of existing electric power distribution 
systems are evolving and changing. As a result, the digitalisation of 
the distribution network is gaining attention for effective real-time 
monitoring and control. Cyber-Physical cosimulation is one of the 
options for implementing and testing novel concepts and ideas before 
actual implementation on the distribution network. Therefore, this paper
 presents some experiences on the cyber-physical testbed in the 
distribution network. Moreover, the methodology, possible challenges and
 mitigation techniques are also presented for a cyber-physical 
cosimulation testbed of optimal reactive power control in smarter 
distribution network (SDN). The cyber-physical co-simulation testbed is 
analysed using a Typhoon HIL 604 and OpenDSS on a CIGRE MV distribution.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The main motivating factor behind the work is to study the 
interaction between the transmission and the distribution system in more
 detail than currently possible. This is particularly important at high 
PV penetration levels. The developed toolkit allows capturing the 
coupling between the transmission and the distribution system (T&amp;D) 
for steady-state and dynamic analysis, thereby furthering our 
understanding of how the T&amp;D systems interact. One of the objectives
 of the work is to answer the question, “which analysis require T&amp;D 
simulation”. To this end, the team held discussions with the utility 
advisory group (UAG) and identified use cases that are of most interest 
and studied them in detail. Based on the use cases the team was able to 
suggest whether the T&amp;D analysis is a necessity for a particular 
study. The developed techniques, which are documented in detail through 
publications, are important additions to the literature in power system 
co-simulation. The publications and the open sourced tools (PFLOW and 
IGMS) that resulted from this project are highly valuable resources to 
the researchers in this area.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Electrification and the growth of distributed energy resources
 (DERs), including flexible loads, are changing the energy landscape of 
electric distribution systems and creating new challenges and 
opportunities for electric utilities. Changes in demand profiles require
 improvements in distribution system load models, which have not 
historically accounted for device controllability or impacts on customer
 comfort. Although building modeling research has focused on these 
features, there is a need to incorporate them into distribution load 
models that include DERs and can be used to study grid-interactive 
buildings. In this paper, we present the Object-oriented, Controllable, 
High-resolution Residential Energy (OCHRE) model. OCHRE is a 
controllable thermal-electric residential energy model that captures 
building thermal dynamics, integrates grid-dependent electrical 
behavior, contains models for common DERs and end-use loads, and 
simulates at a time resolution down to 1&nbsp;minute. It includes models
 for space heaters, air conditioners, water heaters, electric vehicles, 
photovoltaics, and batteries that are externally controllable and 
integrated in a co-simulation framework. Using a proposed zero energy 
ready community in Colorado, we co-simulate a distribution grid and 498 
all-electric homes with a diverse set of efficiency levels and equipment
 properties. We show that controllable devices can reduce peak demand 
within a neighborhood by up to 73% during a critical peak period without
 sacrificing occupant comfort. We also demonstrate the importance of 
modeling load diversity at a high time resolution when quantifying power
 and voltage fluctuations across a distribution system.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Increased charging needs from widespread adoption of battery 
electric vehicles (EVs) will impact electricity demand. This will likely
 require a combination of potentially costly distribution infrastructure
 upgrades and synergistic grid-transportation solutions such as managed 
charging and strategic charger placement. Fully implementing such 
strategic planning and control methods—including business models and 
mechanisms to engage and compensate consumers—can minimize or even 
eliminate required grid upgrades. Moreover, there are also opportunities
 for EV charging to support the grid by helping solve existing and 
emerging distribution system challenges associated with increasing 
distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar generation and battery
 energy storage. This paper reviews the potential impacts of EV charging
 on electricity distribution systems and describes methods from the 
literature to efficiently integrate EVs into distribution systems.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS) are 
increasingly deployed to manage potential adverse impacts of DERs on 
distribution feeder voltages. However, communication channels used by 
DERMS controllers, along with the unmanned substations where they are 
deployed, provide a target for cyber attackers to cause severe voltage 
disturbances. The voltage problems can damage equipment, trip inverters,
 and cause undesirable operations of voltage regulating devices. In this
 paper, using detailed cyber-physical models, the various cyberattack 
paths an adversary may use to conduct falsified control command 
cyberattacks are presented. Robust and fast acting centralized cyber 
layer and de-centralized inverter intrusion detection are also proposed.
 This two-tiered system can detect and mitigate these cyberattacks 
before the power system layer is impacted, even if the DERMS controller 
itself has been compromised. The cyberattack models and proposed 
intrusion detection techniques have been validated using IEEE test 
feeders.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>A modeling framework integrating both building energy modeling
 and power system modeling is introduced for the design of net zero 
energy (NZE) districts for the simultaneous selection of both 
demand-side efficiency measures and supply-side generation technologies.
 A novel district control scheme is proposed for pursuing NZE on a 
subhourly basis while mitigating potential grid impacts such as power 
backfeeding and voltage violations. As a case study, Peña Station NEXT, a
 new 100-building, mixed-use district on a 1200-node distribution feeder
 in Denver, Colorado, is modeled in the integrated framework. An 
exhaustive scenario analysis is conducted for sizing the district's 
distributed energy resources, considering multiple objectives such as 
capital cost, net energy import, and equipment violations. When trying 
to achieve annual NZE, the district incurs frequent operating 
violations, and achieving NZE on a 15-min basis is also limited by 
seasonal fluctuations in photovoltaic output, illustrating the need for 
diverse generation or seasonal storage. As a practical compromise, both 
annual and 15-min district import can be reduced by ∼78% without 
significant violations.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This report describes work performed by the Hawaiian Electric 
Companies and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to model 
and simulate advanced inverter grid-support functions and to validate 
and expand on those simulations through a field pilot study. This work 
builds on earlier research, referred to as the Voltage Regulation 
Operational Strategies study. The objective of both is to investigate 
functionalities available in most photovoltaic (PV) inverters to 
modulate active and reactive power autonomously based on local voltage 
measurements for the purpose of mitigating off-nominal grid voltage 
conditions. Specifically of interest are volt/volt-ampere reactive (VAR)
 control and volt/watt control, the effect of those functions on 
quasi-steady-state feeder voltages, and the impact of the functions on 
PV energy production. Because volt/VAR and volt/watt control 
autonomously adjust inverter output based on local conditions without 
requiring communication with any other devices, they are good candidates
 to increase PV hosting capacity when it is limited by voltage 
constraints in a feeder with very large numbers of PV systems.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Unbalanced three-phase low-voltage distribution networks 
(LVDNs) modeling, optimization, and control are essential for enabling 
high photovoltaic (PV) penetration levels. Accordingly, a new case study
 is developed to show the gaps and challenges at different PV 
penetration levels in LVDNs. In this case study, the aim is to provide a
 better understanding of LVDNs’ behavior in order to support the 
development and validation of the models and tools. Therefore, a 
reduction model is proposed to decrease the simulation time by lowering 
the number of buses in the IEEE European LV Test Feeder, with a 
negligible error. In addition, an OpenDSS-Julia interface is developed 
to demonstrate the effects of different PV penetration levels on the 
inverters’ behavior, active power curtailment, and voltage level in 
LVDNs. Results are demonstrated concerning several limitations and 
challenges in using existing smart inverter control techniques, in terms
 of the inverters’ behavior, active power curtailment, and the voltage 
level. These limitations and challenges include over-voltage issues 
using the constant power factor technique, high active power curtailment
 using the volt–watt technique, and high current flows in the network 
assets and poor power factors using the volt–var technique. In addition,
 state-of-the-art system models have not taken-into-account the modeling
 of uncertainty effects on the performance of PV modules. Similarly, 
such models have largely ignored the internal and standby losses in the 
inverter models. These neglected issues may lead to under- or 
over-estimation of the impacts of PV systems on LVDNs and inaccurate 
estimations of the network’s ability to accommodate high PV penetration 
levels.</td>

						<td>The paper describes the process of optimizing a battery energy
 storage in a asymmetric distribution network with two uncontrolled 
distribution energy sources using two programs, OpenDSS and Python. 
Python was used for optimization, while OpenDSS was used to create a 
virtual distribution network and as a tool for calculating. In Python, 
differential evolution was used, an evolutionary strategy with an 
objective to find global minimum. The function whose global minimum was 
sought after were total system losses over a period of one day with 
invervals of one hour. Lower losses in network were achieved, but a more
 significant result was achieved in the form of more efficient 
distribution network, considering that the voltage profile of that 
network was within the limits of set norm.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Optimal power flow (OPF) problems, which dispatch power 
targets to controllable generating units across a network, must 
generally account for non-convex constraints on power flow. Adapting 
those problems so as to make them solvable with convex optimization 
techniques is an area of much academic and operational interest. In this
 paper, we present a method for solving OPF as a quadratic program by 
iteratively refining and re-initializing a linearized model of power 
flow based on the outputs of an associated nonlinear solver. The linear 
model on which we demonstrate this method is an adapted version of an 
approximation designed for use with unbalanced distribution networks. As
 an important benefit, the model allows for the explicit inclusion of 
nodal voltage phasor values in both the OPF problem's objective and its 
constraints, which opens the door to the idea of phasor-based control 
(PBC) design. We show in simulations on the IEEE 13-node test feeder 
that our method quickly converges to a set of phasor targets that are 
sufficiently precise for use in operations at the distribution level.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>High penetrations of distributed photovoltaics (PV) could 
cause adverse grid impacts, such as voltage violations. The recent 
development in inverter technologies provides the opportunity to develop
 control systems to realize effective PV governance, and thus, to 
improve dynamic PV hosting capacity for distribution grids. In this 
article, a novel distributed energy resource management system (DERMS) 
solution is proposed by adopting the real-time optimal power flow 
approach for coordinated control of the distributed PV inverters. The 
proposed approach eliminates the dependence on load knowledge via 
measurement feedback correction, and it can be implemented in real time.
 One challenge is that the technique is sensitive to the data 
availability and integrity of voltage measurements. Therefore, a 
decentralized DERMS approach is developed by leveraging the concepts of 
state estimation. The framework and the effectiveness of the solution 
approach are numerically demonstrated on a real distribution feeder in 
Southern California.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This report presents an analytical methodology to identify 
alternative options to manage interconnection costs and streamline 
interconnection timelines for distribution system-connected photovoltaic
 (PV) systems not co-located with load. Specifically, the report details
 the methodology and results of an analysis that: 1. Identifies 
potential grid violations that would be induced by a PV system 
requesting interconnection to a distribution circuit; 2. Identifies 
multiple technically viable options for mitigating the potential 
violations, including infrastructure upgrades, downsizing the PV system 
size, curtailment of PV, and addition of battery energy storage; 3. 
Defines the required technical operating parameters of the system in 
order to mitigate all potential violations (the "Operating Envelope"); 
4. Compares the economics of each option, from the PV developer's 
perspective. The analysis supports the ongoing evolution of 
interconnection standards for combined PV and energy storage systems by 
providing a methodology to define allowable maximum export limits during
 each hour. The methodology presented could be used by utilities as part
 of the interconnection study process, to inform negotiations with DER 
developers and the drafting of mutually acceptable interconnection 
agreements. The resulting technical operating parameters could be 
included as part of the interconnection service agreement (ISA) between 
the system owner and the utility company. The companion report to this 
analysis, Gill et al. (2022), details the envisioned framework for the 
implementation of the technical operating parameters.</td>

						<td>This paper investigates the feedback control challenge of

the convexity of the stable linear feedback matrix region, and 
investigate the stability of Single Input Single Output Phasor Control 
(SISOPC) with gains chosen based on the reactance of the Thevenin

Quadratic Phasor Controller (LQPC), which generates a multiple input

 three phase injections. We demonstrate the performance of the LQPC

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Distribution network reconfiguration, as a part of the 
distribution management system, plays an important role in increasing 
the energy efficiency of the distribution network by coordinating the 
operations of the switches in the distribution network. Dynamic 
distribution network reconfiguration (DDNR), enabled by the sufficient 
number of remote switching devices in the distribution network, attempts
 to find the optimal topologies of the distribution network over the 
specified time interval. This paper proposes data-driven DDNR based on 
deep reinforcement learning (DRL). DRL-based DDNR controller aims to 
minimize the objective function, i.e. active energy losses and the cost 
of switching manipulations while satisfying the constraints. The 
following constraints are considered: allowed bus voltages, allowed line
 apparent powers, a radial network configuration with all buses being 
supplied, and the maximal allowed number of switching operations. This 
optimization problem is modelled as a Markov decision process by 
defining the possible states and actions of the DDNR agent (controller) 
and rewards that lead the agent to minimize the objective function while
 satisfying the constraints. Switching operation constraints are 
modelled by modifying the action space definition instead of including 
the additional penalty term in the reward function, to increase the 
computational efficiency. The proposed algorithm was tested on three 
test examples: small benchmark network, real-life large-scale test 
system and IEEE 33-bus radial system, and the results confirmed the 
robustness and scalability of the proposed algorithm.</td>

equipment resulting from high current. The installed capacity at which 
violations first occur and above which would require system upgrades is 
called the hosting capacity. Current static methods for determining 
hosting capacity tend to either consider infrequent worst-case snapshots
 in time and/or capture coarse time and spatial resolution. Because the 
duration of violations cannot be captured with these traditional 
methods, the metric thresholds used in these studies conservatively use 
the strictest constraints given in operating standards, even though both
 worse voltage performance and higher overloads may be temporarily 
acceptable. However, assessing the full details requires accurately 
capturing time-dependence, voltage-regulating equipment operations, and 
performance of advanced controls-based mitigation techniques. In this 
paper, we propose a dynamic distributed photovoltaic hosting capacity 
methodology to address these issues by conducting power flow analysis 
for a full year. A key contribution is the formulation of time aware 
metrics to take these annual results and identify the hosting capacity. 
Through a case study, we show that this approach can more fully capture 
grid impacts of distributed photovoltaic than traditional methods and 
the dynamic hosting capacity was 60%–200% higher than the static hosting
 capacity in this case study.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper develops a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to 
solve a cooperative, multi-agent Volt-Var Control (VVC) problem for high
 solar penetration distribution systems. The ingenuity of our RL method 
lies in a novel two-stage progressive training strategy that can 
effectively improve training speed and convergence of the machine 
learning algorithm. In Stage 1 (individual training), while holding all 
the other agents inactive, we separately train each agent to obtain its 
own optimal VVC actions in the action space: consume, generate, 
do-nothing. In Stage 2 (cooperative training), all agents are trained 
again coordinately to share VVC responsibility. Rewards and costs in our
 RL scheme include (i) a system-level reward (for taking an action), 
(ii) an agent-level reward (for doing-nothing), and (iii) an agent-level
 action cost function. This new framework allows rewards to be 
dynamically allocated to each agent based on their contribution while 
accounting for the trade-off between control effectiveness and action 
cost. The proposed methodology is tested and validated in a modified 
IEEE 123-bus system using realistic PV and load profiles. Simulation 
results confirm that the proposed approach is robust, and 
computationally efficient and achieves desirable volt-var control 
performance under a wide range of operation conditions.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This project is aimed at creating a transactive energy market 
to address the challenges faced by utility providers when increasing 
distributed energy resource (DER) adoption in their service area. One 
major challenge is mitigating export back to the grid during times of 
excess production. The transactive energy market operates at the 
distribution level and balances the supply and demand on the feeder, 
thus maintaining a zero-energy export at the primary feeder head. The 
market participants in this case are the residential customers on the 
feeder, who bid into the market. Building controls are then optimized 
based on the settled price. Market performance was demonstrated in this 
study by simulating different levels of DER penetration on a selected 
Pepco feeder. The feeder successfully achieved a zero export while 
providing cost-effective electricity to the participants, demonstrating 
that this market design can enable high DER penetration on existing 
feeders.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>An increase in Electric Vehicles (EV) will result in higher 
demands on the distribution electric power systems (EPS) which may 
result in thermal line overloading and low voltage violations. To 
understand the impact, this work simulates two EV charging scenarios 
(home- and work-dominant) under potential 2030 EV adoption levels on 10 
actual distribution feeders that support residential, commercial, and 
industrial loads. The simulations include actual driving patterns of 
existing (non-EV) vehicles taken from global positioning system (GPS) 
data. The GPS driving behaviors, which explain the spatial and temporal 
EV charging demands, provide information on each vehicles travel 
distance, dwell locations, and dwell durations. Then, the EPS 
simulations incorporate the EV charging demands to calculate the power 
flow across the feeder. Simulation results show that voltage impacts are
 modest (less than 0.01 p.u.), likely due to robust feeder designs and 
the models only represent the high-voltage (“primary”) system 
components. Line loading impacts are more noticeable, with a maximum 
increase of about 15%. Additionally, the feeder peak load times 
experience a slight shift for residential and mixed feeders (≈1 h), not 
at all for the industrial, and 8 h for the commercial feeder.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>With increasing penetration of distributed energy resources in
 the distribution network, voltage levels become a concern. However, 
power flow models for these networks are rare due to the complexity to 
collect and manage large amounts of feeder data in a way that suits 
engineering analysis. Unfortunately, even the network model exists, the 
quality of data may not be high enough for power flow analysis. In this 
paper, a comprehensive 4-wire low-voltage network is built, starting 
from reliable topology and approximate sequence impedances, and 
simulation results are compared to the uncleaned data and a simplified 
3-wire representation. Power flow with photovoltaic penetration is also 
carried out. Results indicate that the improved network data has a 
higher occurrence of undervoltage situations. Using a 4-wire network 
with neutral wire can more accurately reflect the influence of 
neutral-to-ground voltage, even in the presence of frequent grounding. 
Both undervoltage and overvoltage deteriorate with PV penetration due to
 neutral voltage fluctuation.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The increase in the photovoltaic generation on distribution 
grids may create problems, such as voltage-violations. To gain 
situational awareness for system operation, e.g., adjusting the 
tap-settings of the transformers or adjust capacitor banks, utilities 
need situational awareness about locations and amounts of photovoltaic 
powers being generated in different feeders. Unfortunately, many 
utilities not only lack observability of the distribution grid, e.g., no
 secondary grid schematics but also have no situational awareness on 
which feeders solar panels locate. To understand where the solar users 
are roughly, we propose to use the feeder measurements from utilities 
with solar panel measurements from third-party solar companies. Due to 
the property of active correlation detection, we propose several 
sequentially improved methods based on quantitative association rule 
mining (QARM), where we also provide a lower bound for performance 
guarantees based on the amount of available data and the size of the bin
 for clustering. However, the binning of data leads to information loss.
 So, we design a band to replace bin for creating a new data mining 
approach for robustness. We validate our result for the IEEE 4-, 8-, 
123-, 8500-bus cases with the Pecan-Street dataset, and also for the 
IEEE 123-bus case under low/high penetration and with radial/weakly 
meshed configurations. For realistic validation, we also obtain real 
data from a utility and a solar power company in the same zip codes in a
 city of California. Numerical results show accurate associations of 
feeders and solar panels, leading to increased situational awareness of 
the secondary distribution grids.</td>

						<td>In this work, we present a generic co-simulation platform that

communication network architectures and/or events. The proposed solution
 is built around OpenDSS and Mininet using a python-based wrapper, 
potentially enabling the integration of third-party libraries with ease.
 To demonstrate this concept, the paper presents a Modbus-based DER 
control platform that has been coupled to the IEEE 13 bus system; a 
cyber-physical system that could be used to assess the cyber-resilience 
of different volt-var control strategies. Our paper specifically focuses
 on highlighting the effort-saving features that could be of interest to
 researchers and developers, potentially reducing the number of 
resources needed to build such systems from scratch. Finally, this paper
 represents the first public release of our tool.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>O estudo de novas fontes de geração de energia elétrica, em 
especial, aquelas que atendam as novas exigências ambientais e 
sustentáveis é essencial, uma vez que a energia elétrica é fundamental 
para o desenvolvimento econômico e social. Nesse contexto, a inserção de
 sistemas fotovoltaicos na rede de distribuição se destaca já que não 
requer a instalação de grandes subestações ou longas linhas de 
transmissão. Contudo, devido a sua característica operacional 
intermitente, é necessário que haja um monitoramento constante da 
qualidade da energia elétrica para garantir a continuidade e a 
confiabilidade da energia elétrica nos parâmetros operacionais 
estabelecidos. Este trabalho propôs demonstrar a construção de uma 
interface gráfica em python em conjunto com o \textit{software} OpenDSS 
que contribua futuramente para analises de impacto dos sistemas solares 
fotovoltaicos na qualidade da energia elétrica, sobretudo tensão de 
regime permanente. Como prévia realizou-se um estudo simples de caráter 
demonstrativo de sua potencialidade.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Over the past century, US electric grid has evolved into an 
extremely complex and large interconnected grid identified by the 
National Academy of Engineers (NAE) as the greatest engineering 
achievement of the century. During that period, the overwhelming 
accepted principle was “larger or bigger the better”. The AC 
transmission voltage went up to 765 kV and the individual generating 
units were in excess of 1,000 MW. This centralized generation model was 
considered to be efficient and reliable way to operate the grid. This 
grid continued to serve the nation well. It, however, faced serious 
challenges with the demands of the 21st century that will require high 
penetration of renewable energy, environmental impact of large power 
plants, global warming and climate change, carbon emission and global 
energy sustainability. New approach had to be taken to adopt the new 
regulatory policies. Emerging trends such as low-cost natural gas, 
increased deployment of renewable energy technologies in distribution, 
and continued evolution of electricity markets are transforming the ways
 to generate and deliver electricity. Other factors such as 
environmental policies to reduce the carbon footprint, maximize the 
energy efficiency by utilizing the distributed based renewable energy 
generation also influence the future grid structure. Aging 
infrastructure combined with the growth and the evolving de-centralized 
model will have significant impact on the future grid’s ability to 
provide the electricity more efficiently, reliably, with higher 
resiliency. This dissertation is divided into two parts: (1) to achieve 
greater resiliency, it proposes an integrated T\&amp;D co-simulation 
framework that considers the effects of Distributed Energy Resources 
(DER) in the distribution. (2) to achieve greater reliability, improved 
system protection is needed at the distribution level that considers the
 DER affect such as two-way power flow, low fault currents, etc. This 
dissertation proposes and analyzes the travelling-wave (TW) based 
protection at the distribution level. Integrated T\&amp;D framework and 
the TW based protection improves the grid to be more reliable and 
resilient.</td>

designs and analyzes a novel cyber-physical test system for real-time

Typhoon HIL 604 and the cybernetic layer is represented by software from
 Typhoon HIL, OpenDSS, and Python. The cybernetic layer is used to 
model, design, and control the reactive power from the smart inverter in
 real-time. The distribution network considered is a CIGRE MV 
distribution network. Real-time simulation results demonstrate the 
applicability of the proposed test platform in real-time reactive power

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Energy management of transmission and distribution networks 
(T&amp;D) is becoming more challenging with the accelerated adoption of 
distributed energy resources (DERs)-such as distributed photovoltaic 
generation and battery energy storage systems (BESS)-on the electric 
grid. To better analyze the impacts of DERs on both transmission and 
distribution systems, a comprehensive T&amp;D co-simulation platform is 
developed. Further, with DERs more actively participating in system 
operation-e.g., by providing real-time grid services-their cyber 
vulnerability needs to be better understood to maintain system 
reliability. This paper discusses a cyber-physical events 
emulation-based T&amp;D co-simulation platform to perform comprehensive 
cyber events emulations, physical simulation, and analysis of 
interdependent impacts. Results from the case studies-which show how 
cyber events on a synthetic distribution network can impact operations 
on the transmission and distribution network-validate that the proposed 
T&amp;D cosimulation platform can perform cyber-physical events 
emulation and produce response in near realtime; therefore, with 
extensive simulation using the proposed co-simulation platform, the 
system operators can accumulate adequate training data for system 
situational awareness of grid anomalies.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper presents a graph-based forward looking algorithm 
applied to distribution planning in the context of distributed 
photovoltaic penetration. We study the target hosting capacity problem 
where the objective is to find the least-cost sequence of system 
upgrades to reach a predefined hosting capacity target value. We show 
that commonly used short-term cost minimization approaches often lead to
 suboptimal long-term solutions. By comparing our method against such 
myopic techniques on real distribution systems, we show that our 
algorithm is able to reduce the overall integration costs by looking at 
future decisions. Because hosting capacity is hard to compute, this 
problem requires efficient methods to search the space. We demonstrate 
that heuristics using domain-specific knowledge can be efficiently used 
to improve the algorithm performance, such that real distribution 
systems can be studied.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Common practice in transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) 
systems analysis has been to treat them independently by decoupling 
those at the point of common coupling (PCC). With the large amount of 
distributed energy resources (DER) being added in distribution networks,
 the interactions between T&amp;D systems at PCC produce unacceptable 
errors. This study discusses an alternate approach for the combined 
T&amp;D systems analysis using co-simulation technique. The proposed 
framework couples the analysis of the two systems by iteratively 
exchanging the power flow variables at the PCC. The approach is 
implemented for an IEEE 9-bus transmission test system coupled with the 
IEEE 13-bus distribution test system and the analysis is validated 
against an equivalent stand-alone combined T&amp;D system model.</td>

						<td>This study presents a decision-making model for the dynamic reconfiguration of
distribution networks after contingency situations based on formulations of the selfhealing
problem with islanding. This work develops a three-stage algorithm. The first
stage applies a greedy reconfiguration heuristic, which calculates the criteria values
for each viable network configuration in each hour. To address the variety of criteria,
the analytic hierarchy process method is applied to define the weights. The second
stage addresses the problem statically to reduce the number of configurations and,
therefore, the combinations of step 3. In the third stage, the problem is approached
dynamically, generating the optimal sequence of topologies for the analyzed period,
while considering the time-varying operational conditions of the system. The proposed
heuristic significantly reduces the complexity of the problem while minimizing the
following criteria: energy not supplied, losses, number of interrupted consumers and
switch operations. The physical constraints of the power grid considered in the
proposed model are the line limits, protective equipment settings, voltage limits,
distributed generators (DG) limits and network radiality. The proposed model is
analyzed in different scenarios in the IEEE 123-bus system, modified with the insertion
of DGs. The proposed method is compared with a conventional benchmark model.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Fault localization is a key task on power systems operation 
and maintenance. When it comes to distribution networks, the problem is 
especially challenging due to the non-homogeneous characteristics and 
unique topology of each feeder. This paper presents a method based on 
gated graph neural network for automatic fault localization on 
distribution networks. The method aggregates problem data in a graph, 
where the feeder topology is represented by the graph links and nodes 
attributes can encapsulate any selected information such as operated 
devices, electrical characteristics and measurements at the point. The 
main advantage of the proposed solution is that it is immune to network 
reconfiguration and allows the use of a single trained model on multiple
 feeders. An experiment was conducted with faults simulated on 10 
different feeders, all of them based on actual distribution feeders. The
 results shows that the model is able to generalize the correlations 
learned on training to correctly predict the fault region in most cases,
 even on a feeder it has not seen before.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The popularization of electric vehicles (electric vehicles 
(EVs)) is becoming an unstoppable trend in modern society. Thus, 
efficient simulation tools that can predict the EV operation and 
deployment are significant assets for charging point operators (CPOs), 
electric mobility service providers (EMSPs), charging service providers 
(CSPs) and electricity companies. In this paper, an algorithm for 
simulating the utilization and availability of public EV charging 
stations (CSs) has been developed. Based on several EV user features, 
the proposed algorithm generates realistic scenarios of CS availability,
 utilization, and impact over the distribution network via AC power 
flows. Moreover, the impact of considering smart charging (i.e., remote 
CS power limit control) and price policies is also modeled by the 
proposed algorithm. With these enhancements, the proposed simulation 
tool is used to predict the aggregated behavior of a population of EV 
users within the vicinity of two real distribution feeders. Results show
 the capacity of the proposed algorithm to generate realistic CS 
utilization statistics subject to different smart charging and price 
policies.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Recent advances in technology and financial costs reduction 
are allowing an anticipated insertion of Battery Energy Storage Systems 
(BESSs) in the low-voltage (LV) distribution systems, especially in 
customers owning a photovoltaic (PV) generation system. On the other 
hand, utilities are also installing medium-size BESSs on LV systems to 
assist in system operation. This massive integration of medium and 
small-sized BESS into PV-rich LV systems can create adverse impacts on 
the circuit operation as each BESS can operate with a different control 
mode, with different control settings. Therefore, since there are 
distinct control modes of operation, it is necessary to analyze them and
 how their parametrization and combined operation affect the grid 
indices. The parametrization and impacts of multiple BESS operating in 
an LV system are investigated in this paper through quasi-static time 
series simulations on a real LV gated community network with high PV 
penetration. The results reveal the need for properly coordinating the 
operation of the multiple BESS, otherwise, operating indices of the grid
 may deteriorate significantly.</td>

system. Among them, we highlight the profit from the purchase and sale 
of electricity and the improvement of the voltage profile. The objective
 of this work is to evaluate the operation of the storage system by 
using the Multi-objective Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization 
(MEPSO) to perform energy arbitrage and jointly improve the voltage 
profile of the network. The MEPSO is used to find a set of operational 
decisions to buy or store energy using the prices of the Day-Ahead 
Market (DAM) and, within these decisions, to operate the ESS during the 
Real-Time Market (RTM) hours. The results are promising and evidence 
that, through the proposed methodology, it is possible to perform energy
 arbitrage with the improvement of the voltage profile and a low number 
of charging/discharging cycles.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Unbalanced faults in distribution feeders can impact voltages 
on the non-faulted phases. This paper models a real-life feeder with a 
high penetration level of solar photovoltaic (PV) units in detail 
including the secondary circuits, and shows a large voltage swell in one
 of the non-faulted phases of the feeder during a single line to ground 
fault. The voltages seen during this swell are more than 1.2 p.u., which
 can have detrimental impacts on the connected equipment and can also 
lead to loss of connected generation. The reason for this voltage swell 
is found to be the equivalent impedance at the fault location resulting 
from the ratio of zero and positive sequence cable impedances. It is 
seen that the connected solar PV units with appropriate control are able
 to reduce the severity of the voltage swell, especially for higher 
penetration levels of solar PV considered, but not entirely eliminate 
it.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Smart meters have been deployed for replacing 
electromechanical energy meters around the world. As these new devices 
have the capability to transmit information, utilities seek for new 
applications and functionalities to add value for the new meters. In 
this context, this paper presents a method for customer rephasing using 
measurements of active and reactive powers acquired from customers' 
smart meters. The main purposes of such an application are to reduce 
feeders' technical losses and voltage unbalance. A representative 
express feeder from a Brazilian utility is utilized as a test system. 
Results show that the proposed method can reduce 33% of technical losses
 and up to 80% of the voltage unbalance in the system. Additionally, the
 probabilistic assessment shows that the method performance is robust to
 missing data, e.g., its efficiency is not impacted for cases when 
reactive power measurements are not available.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In 2021, an average of 5.5 generators were connected every day
 in Brazilian MV distribution systems, and 98.9% of these generators are
 photovoltaic. The increased penetration of MV distributed generation 
has been accompanied by a rise in the workload of utility planning 
engineers, who must study and propose solutions to enable the connection
 of every MV generator. In this context, this work proposes a quick 
first-assessment approach to identify if the required connection can be 
approved or if further studies are required. The proposed approach 
focuses on the most restrictive steady-state technical impacts 
(overvoltage and overload) related to the increased penetration of MV 
distributed generators. The proposed approach consists of building 
connection assessment diagrams that can successfully speed up the 
required analyses and, consequently, decrease person-hour costs.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The worldwide adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is a trend 
encouraged by sustainable policies that a growing number of countries 
are supporting. Consequently, the EV charging market players is a 
concept that is receiving particular attention, in which the charging 
station operator (CPO) is the player responsible for the infrastructure 
of the public EV charging stations (EVCSs). On the other hand, the 
integration of distributed energy resources (DER) and EVs within the 
electrical system requires the development of algorithms that allow CPOs
 to manage renewable energy sources aiming to serve EV charging. 
Internet of Things (IoT) makes it possible to develop an IoT platform 
that can help with the integration of a smart charging algorithm with 
the CPO. In this paper, a characterization of the IoT-middleware DOJOT 
platform (developed by the Brazilian research center CPqD) combined with
 two softwares developed under a Brazilian R&amp;D project has been 
realized. The software under development aims to generate monthly 
policies for price variation and power limits for EVCSs and to perform 
smart charging of EVs considering DERs. Additionally, The evaluation was
 made through the performance of the DOJOT IoT platform and the software
 according to the number of devices that must be processed, internet 
connection quality, and multiprocessing.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Distribution networks are exposed to new challenges due to the
 evolution of technology, requiring planning engineers to perform 
studies with greater regularity with more detailed electric models, to 
improve network decision-making processes. This paper proposes an 
approach to periodically build, a validated OpenDSS distribution network
 model for network planning, converting electric elements of Geographic 
Information System to Common Information Model files, which can be used 
to feed Distribution System Management and OpenDSS platforms, closing 
gaps between these two systems. The proposal enables a fast conversion 
of 100% of a distribution network, reducing time for decision making and
 giving more robustness to planning studies and further analysis. 
Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 
approach in creating suitable and open-source network models, with high 
accuracy, for a variety of studies for network planning helping Smart 
Grid implementation and power quality enhancements.</td>
