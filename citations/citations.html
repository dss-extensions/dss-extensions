					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Unbalanced three-phase low-voltage distribution networks 
(LVDNs) modeling, optimization, and control are essential for enabling 
high photovoltaic (PV) penetration levels. Accordingly, a new case study
 is developed to show the gaps and challenges at different PV 
penetration levels in LVDNs. In this case study, the aim is to provide a
 better understanding of LVDNs’ behavior in order to support the 
development and validation of the models and tools. Therefore, a 
reduction model is proposed to decrease the simulation time by lowering 
the number of buses in the IEEE European LV Test Feeder, with a 
negligible error. In addition, an OpenDSS-Julia interface is developed 
to demonstrate the effects of different PV penetration levels on the 
inverters’ behavior, active power curtailment, and voltage level in 
LVDNs. Results are demonstrated concerning several limitations and 
challenges in using existing smart inverter control techniques, in terms
 of the inverters’ behavior, active power curtailment, and the voltage 
level. These limitations and challenges include over-voltage issues 
using the constant power factor technique, high active power curtailment
 using the volt–watt technique, and high current flows in the network 
assets and poor power factors using the volt–var technique. In addition,
 state-of-the-art system models have not taken-into-account the modeling
 of uncertainty effects on the performance of PV modules. Similarly, 
such models have largely ignored the internal and standby losses in the 
inverter models. These neglected issues may lead to under- or 
over-estimation of the impacts of PV systems on LVDNs and inaccurate 
estimations of the network’s ability to accommodate high PV penetration 
levels.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper presents a decision-making model for the dynamic 
reconfiguration of distribution networks after contingency situations 
based on formulations of the self-healing problem with islanding. This 
paper develops a three-stage algorithm. The first stage applies a greedy
 reconfiguration heuristic, which calculates the criteria values for 
each viable network configuration in each hour. To address the variety 
of criteria, the analytic hierarchy process method is applied to define 
the weights. The second stage addresses the problem statically to reduce
 the number of configurations and, therefore, the combinations of step 
3. In the third stage, the problem is approached dynamically, generating
 the optimal sequence of topologies for the analyzed period, while 
considering the time-varying operational conditions of the system. The 
proposed heuristic significantly reduces the complexity of the problem 
while minimizing the following criteria: energy not supplied, losses, 
number of interrupted consumers and switch operations. The physical 
constraints of the power grid considered in the proposed model are the 
line limits, protective equipment settings, voltage limits, distributed 
generators (DG) limits and network radiality. The proposed model is 
analyzed in different scenarios in the IEEE 123-bus system, modified 
with the insertion of DGs. The proposed method is compared with a 
conventional benchmark model.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>With the rise of integration of renewable energy sources, 
existing electric power distribution networks are facing a variety of 
technical obstacles, one of which is modelling of the distribution 
networks for real-time network monitoring and control. This research 
designs and analyzes a novel cyber-physical test system for real-time 
reactive power compensation from smart inverters in the active 
distribution network using cyber-physical co-simulation between the 
Typhoon HIL and OpenDSS. The testbed is a two-layer system, with a 
physical and cybernetic layer. The physical layer is represented by 
Typhoon HIL 604 and the cybernetic layer is represented by software from
 Typhoon HIL, OpenDSS, and Python. The cybernetic layer is used to 
model, design, and control the reactive power from the smart inverter in
 real-time. The distribution network considered is a CIGRE MV 
distribution network. Real-time simulation results demonstrate the 
applicability of the proposed test platform in real-time reactive power 
control.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The main motivating factor behind the work is to study the 
interaction between the transmission and the distribution system in more
 detail than currently possible. This is particularly important at high 
PV penetration levels. The developed toolkit allows capturing the 
coupling between the transmission and the distribution system (T&amp;D) 
for steady-state and dynamic analysis, thereby furthering our 
understanding of how the T&amp;D systems interact. One of the objectives
 of the work is to answer the question, “which analysis require T&amp;D 
simulation”. To this end, the team held discussions with the utility 
advisory group (UAG) and identified use cases that are of most interest 
and studied them in detail. Based on the use cases the team was able to 
suggest whether the T&amp;D analysis is a necessity for a particular 
study. The developed techniques, which are documented in detail through 
publications, are important additions to the literature in power system 
co-simulation. The publications and the open sourced tools (PFLOW and 
IGMS) that resulted from this project are highly valuable resources to 
the researchers in this area.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This report describes work performed by the Hawaiian Electric 
Companies and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to model 
and simulate advanced inverter grid-support functions and to validate 
and expand on those simulations through a field pilot study. This work 
builds on earlier research, referred to as the Voltage Regulation 
Operational Strategies study. The objective of both is to investigate 
functionalities available in most photovoltaic (PV) inverters to 
modulate active and reactive power autonomously based on local voltage 
measurements for the purpose of mitigating off-nominal grid voltage 
conditions. Specifically of interest are volt/volt-ampere reactive (VAR)
 control and volt/watt control, the effect of those functions on 
quasi-steady-state feeder voltages, and the impact of the functions on 
PV energy production. Because volt/VAR and volt/watt control 
autonomously adjust inverter output based on local conditions without 
requiring communication with any other devices, they are good candidates
 to increase PV hosting capacity when it is limited by voltage 
constraints in a feeder with very large numbers of PV systems.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Common practice in transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) 
systems analysis has been to treat them independently by decoupling 
those at the point of common coupling (PCC). With the large amount of 
distributed energy resources (DER) being added in distribution networks,
 the interactions between T&amp;D systems at PCC produce unacceptable 
errors. This study discusses an alternate approach for the combined 
T&amp;D systems analysis using co-simulation technique. The proposed 
framework couples the analysis of the two systems by iteratively 
exchanging the power flow variables at the PCC. The approach is 
implemented for an IEEE 9-bus transmission test system coupled with the 
IEEE 13-bus distribution test system and the analysis is validated 
against an equivalent stand-alone combined T&amp;D system model.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>With increasing penetration of distributed energy resources in
 the distribution network, voltage levels become a concern. However, 
power flow models for these networks are rare due to the complexity to 
collect and manage large amounts of feeder data in a way that suits 
engineering analysis. Unfortunately, even the network model exists, the 
quality of data may not be high enough for power flow analysis. In this 
paper, a comprehensive 4-wire low-voltage network is built, starting 
from reliable topology and approximate sequence impedances, and 
simulation results are compared to the uncleaned data and a simplified 
3-wire representation. Power flow with photovoltaic penetration is also 
carried out. Results indicate that the improved network data has a 
higher occurrence of undervoltage situations. Using a 4-wire network 
with neutral wire can more accurately reflect the influence of 
neutral-to-ground voltage, even in the presence of frequent grounding. 
Both undervoltage and overvoltage deteriorate with PV penetration due to
 neutral voltage fluctuation.</td>

<div><p>In the residential sector, there is considerable growth in 
smart, interactive devices including thermostats, water heaters, 
electric vehicle chargers, solar panels, and battery systems. These 
devices can all provide the electric grid with additional flexibility, 
which is a valuable resource for grid operators and helps reduce system 
costs and emissions. However, it is difficult to control these devices 
because there is considerable diversity in the residential housing stock
 and because the controls depend on stochastic variables such as weather
 and occupant behavior. We present a stochastic control framework for 
home energy management systems that can control these devices while 
accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty. To do this, we first 
develop an integrated residential energy model that can simulate 
multiple controllable devices with high resolution and can interface 
with external controllers. We then design a control framework with a 
linear residential energy model, a forecast generator that provides 
realistic estimates of weather and occupancy variables, and a control 
objective that captures energy costs and occupant comfort. The control 
framework is used to evaluate the performance of heuristic, 
deterministic, and stochastic control methods, primarily model 
predictive control.We show that the stochastic model predictive control 
performs best in scenarios with realistic levels of uncertainty. We also
 validate the residential energy models and show the benefits of 
high-fidelity modeling for building-to-grid co-simulation studies. The 
results shown in this dissertation provide a deeper understanding of 
residential load flexibility in uncertain conditions, and the frameworks
 developed enable future research for evaluating flexible loads in a 
broad set of applications.</p></div>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The increase in the photovoltaic generation on distribution 
grids may create problems, such as voltage-violations. To gain 
situational awareness for system operation, e.g., adjusting the 
tap-settings of the transformers or adjust capacitor banks, utilities 
need situational awareness about locations and amounts of photovoltaic 
powers being generated in different feeders. Unfortunately, many 
utilities not only lack observability of the distribution grid, e.g., no
 secondary grid schematics but also have no situational awareness on 
which feeders solar panels locate. To understand where the solar users 
are roughly, we propose to use the feeder measurements from utilities 
with solar panel measurements from third-party solar companies. Due to 
the property of active correlation detection, we propose several 
sequentially improved methods based on quantitative association rule 
mining (QARM), where we also provide a lower bound for performance 
guarantees based on the amount of available data and the size of the bin
 for clustering. However, the binning of data leads to information loss.
 So, we design a band to replace bin for creating a new data mining 
approach for robustness. We validate our result for the IEEE 4-, 8-, 
123-, 8500-bus cases with the Pecan-Street dataset, and also for the 
IEEE 123-bus case under low/high penetration and with radial/weakly 
meshed configurations. For realistic validation, we also obtain real 
data from a utility and a solar power company in the same zip codes in a
 city of California. Numerical results show accurate associations of 
feeders and solar panels, leading to increased situational awareness of 
the secondary distribution grids.</td>

						<td>This paper presents a graph-based forward looking algorithm

where the objective is to find the least-cost sequence of system 
upgrades to reach a predefined hosting capacity target value. We show 
that commonly used short-term cost minimization approaches often lead to
 suboptimal long-term solutions. By comparing our method against such 
myopic techniques on real distribution systems, we show that our 
algorithm is able to reduce the overall integration costs by looking at 
future decisions. Because hosting capacity is hard to compute, this 
problem requires efficient methods to search the space. We demonstrate 
that heuristics using domain-specific knowledge can be efficiently used 
to improve the algorithm performance, such that real distribution 
systems can be studied.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper proposes a reference framework for a transactive 
energy market based on distributed ledger technology such as blockchain.
 The framework design was based on the engineering requirements of a 
distribution-scale market, including participant needs, expected market 
transactions, and the cybersecurity constructs required to support a 
fair, secure, and efficient market operation. It leverages the existing 
blockchain attributes to provide clear value propositions that are 
applicable to transactive energy market applications. Those attributes 
are evaluated to not only facilitate the energy market mechanisms but 
also assist with the cybersecurity requirements, such as access control 
management (including identification, authentication, and 
authorization); data security and integrity; and resilience management 
(decentralization, scalability, and performance during faults). The 
validity of the proposed framework is demonstrated using a real-time, 
five-minute double-auction market. The results highlight the framework 
benefits and provide a strong validation of its applicability to 
blockchain-based transactive energy systems. The proposed design can 
help to support machine-to-machine transactions that can be directly 
integrated into complex grid operations, such as automated market 
bidding and self-sufficient, resilience-capable grids.</td>

						<td>Increased charging needs from widespread adoption of battery 
electric vehicles (EVs) will impact electricity demand. This will likely
 require a combination of potentially costly distribution infrastructure
 upgrades and synergistic grid-transportation solutions such as managed 
charging and strategic charger placement. Fully implementing such 
strategic planning and control methods—including business models and 
mechanisms to engage and compensate consumers—can minimize or even 
eliminate required grid upgrades. Moreover, there are also opportunities
 for EV charging to support the grid by helping solve existing and 
emerging distribution system challenges associated with increasing 
distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar generation and battery
 energy storage. This paper reviews the potential impacts of EV charging
 on electricity distribution systems and describes methods from the 
literature to efficiently integrate EVs into distribution systems.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>High penetrations of distributed photovoltaics (PV) could 
cause adverse grid impacts, such as voltage violations. The recent 
development in inverter technologies provides the opportunity to develop
 control systems to realize effective PV governance, and thus, to 
improve dynamic PV hosting capacity for distribution grids. In this 
article, a novel distributed energy resource management system (DERMS) 
solution is proposed by adopting the real-time optimal power flow 
approach for coordinated control of the distributed PV inverters. The 
proposed approach eliminates the dependence on load knowledge via 
measurement feedback correction, and it can be implemented in real time.
 One challenge is that the technique is sensitive to the data 
availability and integrity of voltage measurements. Therefore, a 
decentralized DERMS approach is developed by leveraging the concepts of 
state estimation. The framework and the effectiveness of the solution 
approach are numerically demonstrated on a real distribution feeder in 
Southern California.</td>

			<h2>Cyber Risk Analysis and Threat Mitigation Strategies Against

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Distributed Energy Resources penetration levels continue to 
increase across distribution networks, producing a wide variety of 
challenges for system operators. Creating among others, the need for new
 or improved methods that can manage their output characteristics. This 
has led to regulatory amendments that are expected to facilitate secure 
grid operations while continuing to enable increasing levels of 
Distributed Energy Resources penetration. However, it is still unclear 
if these systems will behave as intended in the presence of a cyber 
attack.To address this fundamental question, this work presents a 
detailed cybersecurity analysis on Distributed Energy Resources and 
Internet of Things infrastructure, covering a wide variety of angles 
from assessing device-level vulnerabilities to proposing methods/metrics
 that can quantify risk at the system-level. In addition, this work 
introduces two, fully-virtualized cyber-physical testbeds that have been
 envisioned for cyber-security researchers. It is expected that these 
software-based tools can aid to develop better, more secure Internet of 
Things and Distributed Energy Resource-based deployments.Furthermore, 
methods for ensuring correct operation at the device-level and 
distribution system-level are presented. In specific, a Trusted 
Execution Environment solution, which relies on hardware-level process 
isolation has been developed to provide digital-attestation services on 
analog inputs. The final contribution of this work is the development of
 a distributed fail-safe method for managing Volt-Var operations. The 
proposed method combines local voltage information (from independent 
agents) and simplified network models to determine the expected voltage 
output before actually executing the command using consensus-voting 
techniques. The underlying distributed consensus methods and power 
models work together to ensure that a final decision not only satisfies 
traditional power system constraints such as security (correctness) and 
dependability but also availability and partition tolerance under 
distributed systems theory.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Existing electric power distribution systems are evolving and 
changing as a result of the high renewable energy sources integration. 
Hence, future smart distribution networks will involve various technical
 challenges; one of them is real-time monitoring and controlling the 
network to operate it effectively and efficiently. This paper develops 
and analyzes a cyber-physical co-simulation testbed for real-time 
reactive power control in the smart distribution network. The testbed is
 a two-layer system, with Typhoon HIL 604 representing the physical 
layer and the other layer as a cybernetic layer. The cybernetic layer is
 used to model a test system and control reactive power from smart 
inverters in real-time. The implementation of real-time reactive power 
control of smart inverters on a CIGRE MV distribution network is shown 
in this study. The proposed testbed's usefulness in real-time reactive 
power control is demonstrated through simulation results.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Energy management of transmission and distribution networks 
(T&amp;D) is becoming more challenging with the accelerated adoption of 
distributed energy resources (DERs)-such as distributed photovoltaic 
generation and battery energy storage systems (BESS)-on the electric 
grid. To better analyze the impacts of DERs on both transmission and 
distribution systems, a comprehensive T&amp;D co-simulation platform is 
developed. Further, with DERs more actively participating in system 
operation-e.g., by providing real-time grid services-their cyber 
vulnerability needs to be better understood to maintain system 
reliability. This paper discusses a cyber-physical events 
emulation-based T&amp;D co-simulation platform to perform comprehensive 
cyber events emulations, physical simulation, and analysis of 
interdependent impacts. Results from the case studies-which show how 
cyber events on a synthetic distribution network can impact operations 
on the transmission and distribution network-validate that the proposed 
T&amp;D cosimulation platform can perform cyber-physical events 
emulation and produce response in near realtime; therefore, with 
extensive simulation using the proposed co-simulation platform, the 
system operators can accumulate adequate training data for system 
situational awareness of grid anomalies.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Recent advances in technology and financial costs reduction 
are allowing an anticipated insertion of Battery Energy Storage Systems 
(BESSs) in the low-voltage (LV) distribution systems, especially in 
customers owning a photovoltaic (PV) generation system. On the other 
hand, utilities are also installing medium-size BESSs on LV systems to 
assist in system operation. This massive integration of medium and 
small-sized BESS into PV-rich LV systems can create adverse impacts on 
the circuit operation as each BESS can operate with a different control 
mode, with different control settings. Therefore, since there are 
distinct control modes of operation, it is necessary to analyze them and
 how their parametrization and combined operation affect the grid 
indices. The parametrization and impacts of multiple BESS operating in 
an LV system are investigated in this paper through quasi-static time 
series simulations on a real LV gated community network with high PV 
penetration. The results reveal the need for properly coordinating the 
operation of the multiple BESS, otherwise, operating indices of the grid
 may deteriorate significantly.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Utilizing distributed renewable and energy storage resources 
via peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading has long been touted as a solution
 to improve energy system's resilience and sustainability. Consumers and
 prosumers (those who have energy generation resources), however, do not
 have expertise to engage in repeated P2P trading, and the zero-marginal
 costs of renewables present challenges in determining fair market 
prices. To address these issues, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement 
learning (MARL) framework to help automate consumers' bidding and 
management of their solar PV and energy storage resources, under a 
specific P2P clearing mechanism that utilizes the so-called 
supply-demand ratio. In addition, we show how the MARL framework can 
integrate physical network constraints to realize decentralized voltage 
control, hence ensuring physical feasibility of the P2P energy trading 
and paving ways for real-world implementations.</td>

						<td>O estudo de novas fontes de geração de energia elétrica, em 
especial, aquelas que atendam as novas exigências ambientais e 
sustentáveis é essencial, uma vez que a energia elétrica é fundamental 
para o desenvolvimento econômico e social. Nesse contexto, a inserção de
 sistemas fotovoltaicos na rede de distribuição se destaca já que não 
requer a instalação de grandes subestações ou longas linhas de 
transmissão. Contudo, devido a sua característica operacional 
intermitente, é necessário que haja um monitoramento constante da 
qualidade da energia elétrica para garantir a continuidade e a 
confiabilidade da energia elétrica nos parâmetros operacionais 
estabelecidos. Este trabalho propôs demonstrar a construção de uma 
interface gráfica em python em conjunto com o \textit{software} OpenDSS 
que contribua futuramente para analises de impacto dos sistemas solares 
fotovoltaicos na qualidade da energia elétrica, sobretudo tensão de 
regime permanente. Como prévia realizou-se um estudo simples de caráter 
demonstrativo de sua potencialidade.</td>

Multi-Terminal Soft Open Point (Hybrid MT-SOP) to efficiently provide 
distribution system interconnection capacity. Each leg of the Hybrid 
MT-SOP has an AC/DC converter connected in series with a bank of AC 
switches (Feeder Selector Switches) to allow the converter to connect to
 any of the feeders at a node. Asymmetric converter sizing is shown to 
increase feasible power transfers by up to 50% in the three-terminal 
case, whilst a conic mixed-integer program is formulated to optimally 
select the device configuration and power transfers. A case study shows 
the Hybrid MT-SOP increasing utilization of the converters by more than 
one third, with a 13% increase in system loss reduction as compared to 
an equally-sized MT-SOP.</td>

						<td>Distributed energy resource management systems (DERMS) are 
increasingly deployed to manage potential adverse impacts of DERs on 
distribution feeder voltages. However, communication channels used by 
DERMS controllers, along with the unmanned substations where they are 
deployed, provide a target for cyber attackers to cause severe voltage 
disturbances. The voltage problems can damage equipment, trip inverters,
 and cause undesirable operations of voltage regulating devices. In this
 paper, using detailed cyber-physical models, the various cyberattack 
paths an adversary may use to conduct falsified control command 
cyberattacks are presented. Robust and fast acting centralized cyber 
layer and de-centralized inverter intrusion detection are also proposed.
 This two-tiered system can detect and mitigate these cyberattacks 
before the power system layer is impacted, even if the DERMS controller 
itself has been compromised. The cyberattack models and proposed 
intrusion detection techniques have been validated using IEEE test 
feeders.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Distribution networks are exposed to new challenges due to the
 evolution of technology, requiring planning engineers to perform 
studies with greater regularity with more detailed electric models, to 
improve network decision-making processes. This paper proposes an 
approach to periodically build, a validated OpenDSS distribution network
 model for network planning, converting electric elements of Geographic 
Information System to Common Information Model files, which can be used 
to feed Distribution System Management and OpenDSS platforms, closing 
gaps between these two systems. The proposal enables a fast conversion 
of 100% of a distribution network, reducing time for decision making and
 giving more robustness to planning studies and further analysis. 
Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 
approach in creating suitable and open-source network models, with high 
accuracy, for a variety of studies for network planning helping Smart 
Grid implementation and power quality enhancements.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Distributed photovoltaic systems can cause adverse 
distribution system impacts, including voltage violations at customer 
locations and thermal overload of lines, transformers, and other 
equipment resulting from high current. The installed capacity at which 
violations first occur and above which would require system upgrades is 
called the hosting capacity. Current static methods for determining 
hosting capacity tend to either consider infrequent worst-case snapshots
 in time and/or capture coarse time and spatial resolution. Because the 
duration of violations cannot be captured with these traditional 
methods, the metric thresholds used in these studies conservatively use 
the strictest constraints given in operating standards, even though both
 worse voltage performance and higher overloads may be temporarily 
acceptable. However, assessing the full details requires accurately 
capturing time-dependence, voltage-regulating equipment operations, and 
performance of advanced controls-based mitigation techniques. In this 
paper, we propose a dynamic distributed photovoltaic hosting capacity 
methodology to address these issues by conducting power flow analysis 
for a full year. A key contribution is the formulation of time aware 
metrics to take these annual results and identify the hosting capacity. 
Through a case study, we show that this approach can more fully capture 
grid impacts of distributed photovoltaic than traditional methods and 
the dynamic hosting capacity was 60%–200% higher than the static hosting
 capacity in this case study.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The popularization of electric vehicles (electric vehicles 
(EVs)) is becoming an unstoppable trend in modern society. Thus, 
efficient simulation tools that can predict the EV operation and 
deployment are significant assets for charging point operators (CPOs), 
electric mobility service providers (EMSPs), charging service providers 
(CSPs) and electricity companies. In this paper, an algorithm for 
simulating the utilization and availability of public EV charging 
stations (CSs) has been developed. Based on several EV user features, 
the proposed algorithm generates realistic scenarios of CS availability,
 utilization, and impact over the distribution network via AC power 
flows. Moreover, the impact of considering smart charging (i.e., remote 
CS power limit control) and price policies is also modeled by the 
proposed algorithm. With these enhancements, the proposed simulation 
tool is used to predict the aggregated behavior of a population of EV 
users within the vicinity of two real distribution feeders. Results show
 the capacity of the proposed algorithm to generate realistic CS 
utilization statistics subject to different smart charging and price 
policies.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The worldwide adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is a trend 
encouraged by sustainable policies that a growing number of countries 
are supporting. Consequently, the EV charging market players is a 
concept that is receiving particular attention, in which the charging 
station operator (CPO) is the player responsible for the infrastructure 
of the public EV charging stations (EVCSs). On the other hand, the 
integration of distributed energy resources (DER) and EVs within the 
electrical system requires the development of algorithms that allow CPOs
 to manage renewable energy sources aiming to serve EV charging. 
Internet of Things (IoT) makes it possible to develop an IoT platform 
that can help with the integration of a smart charging algorithm with 
the CPO. In this paper, a characterization of the IoT-middleware DOJOT 
platform (developed by the Brazilian research center CPqD) combined with
 two softwares developed under a Brazilian R&amp;D project has been 
realized. The software under development aims to generate monthly 
policies for price variation and power limits for EVCSs and to perform 
smart charging of EVs considering DERs. Additionally, The evaluation was
 made through the performance of the DOJOT IoT platform and the software
 according to the number of devices that must be processed, internet 
connection quality, and multiprocessing.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Fault localization is a key task on power systems operation 
and maintenance. When it comes to distribution networks, the problem is 
especially challenging due to the non-homogeneous characteristics and 
unique topology of each feeder. This paper presents a method based on 
gated graph neural network for automatic fault localization on 
distribution networks. The method aggregates problem data in a graph, 
where the feeder topology is represented by the graph links and nodes 
attributes can encapsulate any selected information such as operated 
devices, electrical characteristics and measurements at the point. The 
main advantage of the proposed solution is that it is immune to network 
reconfiguration and allows the use of a single trained model on multiple
 feeders. An experiment was conducted with faults simulated on 10 
different feeders, all of them based on actual distribution feeders. The
 results shows that the model is able to generalize the correlations 
learned on training to correctly predict the fault region in most cases,
 even on a feeder it has not seen before.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper introduces a novel approach for generating solar 
photovoltaic (PV) plant deployment scenarios for grid integration 
planning. The approach guarantees consistency among scenarios of the 
same deployment by ensuring that higher penetration scenarios contain PV
 units deployed in lower penetration scenarios. It also constrains the 
size and spatial distribution of the PV plants and considers three 
placement types. A case study on a real-world distribution system proves
 that the precepts of scenario consistency, deployment diversity, and 
placement are met. The study further investigates the impact of the 
resulting scenarios via a stochastic hosting capacity analysis. Results 
indicate that the ratio between PV and load sizes, referred to as the 
nodal PV penetration factor (NPPF), is a key driver of the grid 
integration impact. By reducing the NPPF from 5 to 2, the maximum 
hosting capacity increased by at least 112%. The study also reveals that
 scenarios under random placement can lead to higher hosting capacity 
values.</td>

the same time offering the ability to evaluate the effects of different 
communication network architectures and/or events. The proposed solution
 is built around OpenDSS and Mininet using a python-based wrapper, 
potentially enabling the integration of third-party libraries with ease.
 To demonstrate this concept, the paper presents a Modbus-based DER 
control platform that has been coupled to the IEEE 13 bus system; a 
cyber-physical system that could be used to assess the cyber-resilience 
of different volt-var control strategies. Our paper specifically focuses
 on highlighting the effort-saving features that could be of interest to
 researchers and developers, potentially reducing the number of 
resources needed to build such systems from scratch. Finally, this paper
 represents the first public release of our tool.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The massive and widespread rooftop photovoltaic penetration 
poses new challenges to Distribution System Operators who may need to 
deal with over and undervoltage problems in the same feeder. To tackle 
this issue, this work proposes to use the smart inverters from 
photovoltaic systems to compensate, in real-time, the exact amount of 
reactive power demanded by the customers to which they are connected. 
The proposed strategy does not require expensive and complex 
communication infrastructure, active power curtailment, or inverters 
oversizing. With a simple infrastructure, it decreases energy losses and
 the need for capacitor banks. Time-series power-flow simulations are 
performed in a real distribution system. The results indicate that the 
proposed strategy of var compensation mitigates more energy losses and 
voltage transgression than for the cases in which the smart inverters 
operate with unity power factor, Volt-Watt, or Volt-var control rules.</td>

						<td>The increased penetration of rooftop PV generators in electric
 power distribution networks has caused technical problems, such as 
overvoltage, low power factor, and higher maintenance costs of Volt-var 
control equipment. This work investigates the potential of modern 
Volt-var control technologies in mitigating technical issues aggravated 
by the connection of rooftop PV generators to the distribution systems. 
The performance of the technologies is assessed in terms of the 
violation of steady-state voltage and power factor regulatory limits, 
and the number of operations of controllable devices, which affects 
maintenance costs. Active power loss is also evaluated to identify how 
the technology under analysis affects it. The results can be used to 
guide the utilities in the choice of the most suitable solution (a 
single or a set of equipment) according to the identified technical 
problems.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Optimal power flow (OPF) problems, which dispatch power 
targets to controllable generating units across a network, must 
generally account for non-convex constraints on power flow. Adapting 
those problems so as to make them solvable with convex optimization 
techniques is an area of much academic and operational interest. In this
 paper, we present a method for solving OPF as a quadratic program by 
iteratively refining and re-initializing a linearized model of power 
flow based on the outputs of an associated nonlinear solver. The linear 
model on which we demonstrate this method is an adapted version of an 
approximation designed for use with unbalanced distribution networks. As
 an important benefit, the model allows for the explicit inclusion of 
nodal voltage phasor values in both the OPF problem's objective and its 
constraints, which opens the door to the idea of phasor-based control 
(PBC) design. We show in simulations on the IEEE 13-node test feeder 
that our method quickly converges to a set of phasor targets that are 
sufficiently precise for use in operations at the distribution level.</td>

						<td>This paper investigates the feedback control challenge of 
tracking a voltage phasor target at a given node on an unbalanced three

 modeling the progression of phasors as a martingale and describing the 
input sensitivity with the linearization of the unbalanced three phase 
power flow manifold for the Thevenin equivalent circuit. We establish 
the convexity of the stable linear feedback matrix region, and 
investigate the stability of Single Input Single Output Phasor Control 
(SISOPC) with gains chosen based on the reactance of the Thevenin 
equivalent circuit. To improve upon SISOPC, we propose the Linear 
Quadratic Phasor Controller (LQPC), which generates a multiple input 
multiple output linear feedback matrix which takes into account both the
 network resistance and the mutual impedances that couple the unbalanced
 three phase injections. We demonstrate the performance of the LQPC 
using OpenDSS simulations on an unbalanced three phase distribution 
network, demonstrating the effectiveness of the LQPC.</td>

						<td>In this work, we introduce Log(v) 3LPF, a linear power flow 
solver for unbalanced three-phase distribution systems. Log(v) 3LPF uses
 a logarithmic transform of the voltage phasor to linearize the AC power
 flow equations around the balanced case. We incorporate the modeling of
 ZIP loads, transformers, capacitor banks, switches and their 
corresponding controls and express the network equations in 
matrix-vector form. With scalability in mind, special attention is given
 to the computation of the inverse of the system admittance matrix, 
Ybus. We use the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury identity for an efficient 
computation of the inverse of a rank-k corrected matrix and compare the 
performance of this method with traditional LU decomposition methods 
using Big-$\mathcal O$ notation. We showcase the solver for a variety of
 network sizes, ranging from tens to thousands of nodes, and compare the
 Log(v) 3LPF with commercial-grade software, such as OpenDSS.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Due to the increasing inclusion of renewable energy sources in
 the Distribution System (DS), the interest in Energy Storage Systems 
(ESSs) connected to the network and how to justify the investment has 
grown. By its attractive features such as fast response and decreasing 
price, the ESS can be used in various scenarios in the electrical 
system. Among them, we highlight the profit from the purchase and sale 
of electricity and the improvement of the voltage profile. The objective
 of this work is to evaluate the operation of the storage system by 
using the Multi-objective Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization 
(MEPSO) to perform energy arbitrage and jointly improve the voltage 
profile of the network. The MEPSO is used to find a set of operational 
decisions to buy or store energy using the prices of the Day-Ahead 
Market (DAM) and, within these decisions, to operate the ESS during the 
Real-Time Market (RTM) hours. The results are promising and evidence 
that, through the proposed methodology, it is possible to perform energy
 arbitrage with the improvement of the voltage profile and a low number 
of charging/discharging cycles.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This study presents a decision-making model for the dynamic reconfiguration of
distribution networks after contingency situations based on formulations of the selfhealing
problem with islanding. This work develops a three-stage algorithm. The first
stage applies a greedy reconfiguration heuristic, which calculates the criteria values
for each viable network configuration in each hour. To address the variety of criteria,
the analytic hierarchy process method is applied to define the weights. The second
stage addresses the problem statically to reduce the number of configurations and,
therefore, the combinations of step 3. In the third stage, the problem is approached
dynamically, generating the optimal sequence of topologies for the analyzed period,
while considering the time-varying operational conditions of the system. The proposed
heuristic significantly reduces the complexity of the problem while minimizing the
following criteria: energy not supplied, losses, number of interrupted consumers and
switch operations. The physical constraints of the power grid considered in the
proposed model are the line limits, protective equipment settings, voltage limits,
distributed generators (DG) limits and network radiality. The proposed model is
analyzed in different scenarios in the IEEE 123-bus system, modified with the insertion
of DGs. The proposed method is compared with a conventional benchmark model.</td>

						<td>Unbalanced faults in distribution feeders can impact voltages 
on the non-faulted phases. This paper models a real-life feeder with a 
high penetration level of solar photovoltaic (PV) units in detail 
including the secondary circuits, and shows a large voltage swell in one
 of the non-faulted phases of the feeder during a single line to ground 
fault. The voltages seen during this swell are more than 1.2 p.u., which
 can have detrimental impacts on the connected equipment and can also 
lead to loss of connected generation. The reason for this voltage swell 
is found to be the equivalent impedance at the fault location resulting 
from the ratio of zero and positive sequence cable impedances. It is 
seen that the connected solar PV units with appropriate control are able
 to reduce the severity of the voltage swell, especially for higher 
penetration levels of solar PV considered, but not entirely eliminate 
it.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>An important power quality concern of integrating single-phase
 photovoltaic (PV) generators to low-voltage (LV) residential systems, 
is their impact on harmonic distortions due to their power 
electronic-based interface through a voltage source converter (VSC). 
Unfortunately, most existing single-phase PV models are focused on the 
analysis of an individual device, and do not provide a modular circuit 
model that can be directly integrated into a commercial harmonic power 
flow simulation tool for large-scale power system studies. In response, 
this paper derives a single-input single-output harmonic model for 
single-phase PVs that is independent of grid parameters, thus enabling 
multiple of these devices to be considered simultaneously in system-wide
 harmonic power flow analyses. The model is validated with 
electromagnetic transient simulations and then, characterization studies
 are conducted to determine the expected harmonic impact of these PV 
generators on a real LV system. Results demonstrate these devices can 
increase system damping at typical low order harmonics and are unlikely 
to introduce new resonances at this frequency range. In addition, it is 
essential to model the VSC controller effect for a more accurate 
assessment of its harmonic impact. Sensitivity studies reveal how 
different VSC parameters affect this behavior.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The widespread of active Distribution Networks (DN) is 
encouraging Distribution System Operators (DSO) to increase awareness 
about the real-time status of the network as well as to actively manage 
flexible energy resources for improving system performances. In this 
context, Digital Twin (DT) can be an enabling technology for a low-cost 
distributed framework that supports DN management. DT in the power 
system can be exploited taking advantage of the successful experiences 
in other sectors (e.g., smart manufacturing and building automation). 
This article presents a real case study of a DT development and its 
integration with an existing DN. The DT system architecture is based on 
the recent standards of DT development, main entities are identified and
 enriched with a set of developed tools that enable near real-time 
services such as data collection, state estimation and flexibility 
calculator. The individual performances of the integrated tools and the 
whole efficiency of DT were tested and validated during one month of 
continuous operation. During the operation, good service continuity and 
accuracy performances were reported. Results from the flexibility 
calculator show the effectiveness of the proposed strategies that can 
improve the energy efficiency of the DN by increasing local 
self-consumption of RES production.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Nowadays, the deployment of smart meters is increasing 
worldwide. The information provided by this equipment allows vast 
improvements to grid management. Among the potential applications, the 
mitigation of non-technical losses is an important benefit for the 
utilities and the customers. High levels of unknown consumption 
deteriorate the system operation and increase its costs. Usually, part 
of the non-technical losses costs is assigned to the customers, and part
 to the utilities, representing revenue loss and high-energy tariffs. In
 this scenario, this work investigates the application of smart meters 
measurements to detect and locate non-technical losses in low voltage 
systems. The proposed methodology is based on the coefficient of 
determination evaluation obtained from a multiple linear regression 
model of the circuit. The study cases show that the method can 
successfully detect and locate non-technical losses. However, factors as
 measurements accuracy, resolution, update ratio, desynchronization, and
 the amount of deviated power affect its performance.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Electrification and the growth of distributed energy resources
 (DERs), including flexible loads, are changing the energy landscape of 
electric distribution systems and creating new challenges and 
opportunities for electric utilities. Changes in demand profiles require
 improvements in distribution system load models, which have not 
historically accounted for device controllability or impacts on customer
 comfort. Although building modeling research has focused on these 
features, there is a need to incorporate them into distribution load 
models that include DERs and can be used to study grid-interactive 
buildings. In this paper, we present the Object-oriented, Controllable, 
High-resolution Residential Energy (OCHRE) model. OCHRE is a 
controllable thermal-electric residential energy model that captures 
building thermal dynamics, integrates grid-dependent electrical 
behavior, contains models for common DERs and end-use loads, and 
simulates at a time resolution down to 1&nbsp;minute. It includes models
 for space heaters, air conditioners, water heaters, electric vehicles, 
photovoltaics, and batteries that are externally controllable and 
integrated in a co-simulation framework. Using a proposed zero energy 
ready community in Colorado, we co-simulate a distribution grid and 498 
all-electric homes with a diverse set of efficiency levels and equipment
 properties. We show that controllable devices can reduce peak demand 
within a neighborhood by up to 73% during a critical peak period without
 sacrificing occupant comfort. We also demonstrate the importance of 
modeling load diversity at a high time resolution when quantifying power
 and voltage fluctuations across a distribution system.</td>

differential evolution was used, an evolutionary strategy with an 
objective to find global minimum. The function whose global minimum was 
sought after were total system losses over a period of one day with

			<h2>Phasor-Based Control on Islanded Networks</h2>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The advancement of sensing technologies for the power grid has allowed the development
of new strategies for the control of distributed energy resources (DERs). In particular, the
emergence of phasor measurement units (PMUs) designed for deployment at the distribution
level has presented an exciting opportunity. These PMUs have enabled the development of
phasor-based control (PBC), a strategy that formulates DER power dispatch in terms of
voltage phasor targets to be tracked by local controllers.
This dissertation focuses on the optimal power flow (OPF) component of PBC’s supervisory
control layer, which has previously been conceptualized and demonstrated in simulation on
distribution networks. We expand its applicability to medium-voltage minigrids and micro-
grids operating in island mode, networks where PBC has the potential to deliver important
benefits.
The work is carried out in two stages. After a discussion of PBC and other relevant back-
ground topics, we address one of the primary challenges to PBC at the medium voltage level:
the need for extreme accuracy in the supervisory controller’s generation of phasor targets.
This accuracy is achieved through an adaptation of an iterative OPF methodology that re-
fines a linearized model of power flow through successive exchanges with a nonlinear solver.
We discuss the changes that were made to both linear model and nonlinear solver, as well
as the determination of phasor targets on networks that include tap-changing transformers
and other realistic equipment. The accuracy of the adapted iterative method is then shown
in simulation.
The second stage of the work covers the extension of our OPF implementation to islanded
systems. We present a strategy for the treatment of the slack bus used by our nonlinear
solver and apply it to several test cases in simulation. We then analyze a specific case in
2
which our iterative solution method fails, and demonstrate the use of a penalty factor in
our linearized OPF formulation as a means of overcoming that failure. A full, end-to-end
implementation of PBC’s supervisory layer is then proposed and tested on a number of DER
distributions at different feeder penetration levels.
We end with a presentation of data relevant to instrument-transformer-induced error in PMU
measurements. This final portion stands alone from the primary work of the dissertation, but
remains highly relevant to PBC. From an experimental deployment of two PMUs measuring
an identical distribution-grid voltage, we determine a ratio of the errors induced by their
individual potential transformers. Monitoring this quantity over the course of a year allows us
to track the drift in those induced errors over time, motivating a discussion of the expected
impact of error drift on PBC and the frequency with which transformers will need to be
recalibrated in operational settings.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The massive growth of photovoltaic (PV) generators connected 
to low voltage (LV) systems is making it impractical for utilities to 
conduct a detailed technical analysis to approve every connection 
request. In response, this paper proposes simple equations to quickly 
estimate the PV hosting capacity on any circuit location without the 
need to run power flow simulations. By representing all loads and 
generators as constant current consumption/injection, the superposition 
theorem can be used to calculate the impact of each new PV on voltage 
magnitude and current flows. This approach can be used on a first 
screening assessment to immediately filter out cases that present no 
risk of technical violations to the circuit. Only connection requests 
flagged with risk of violation in this initial screening must be 
analyzed in detail by specialized engineers. Any type of PV connection 
(single-phase, two-phase, three-phase) in unbalanced multiphase LV 
systems can be analyzed. Extensive validation studies reveal that this 
approach is conservative, which makes it safe and reliable for quick 
first screening analyses. Its estimation errors are between 5% and 18%. 
Recommendations on how to employ the proposed approach in practice are 
also presented.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Emerging distributed energy resources (DERs)—such as solar 
photovoltaics (PV), battery energy storage systems (BESS), and electric 
vehicles (EVs)—are expected to increase substantially in India in the 
coming years following policy-driven targets of the Government of India 
to modernize its electricity system, reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
(GHGs), and improve air quality. These emerging technologies can pose 
challenges to distribution utilities, forcing overhauls in planning and 
operational practices. They can also create challenges in power system 
infrastructure planning and cause more frequent system operational 
violations (e.g., network voltage bounds and loading thresholds) if not 
properly integrated. The impacts on the localized power distribution 
grid from these emerging technologies manifest in increased 
infrastructure investments and erratic shifts in demand patterns. These 
impacts are not yet well understood, and analytic solutions are not 
readily available. To address these challenges, the National Renewable 
Energy Laboratory (NREL), in collaboration with BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd.
 (BRPL), developed an advanced power distribution system impact analysis
 framework of BRPL’s distribution system. This framework helps analyze 
the readiness of the power distribution network to accommodate emerging 
technologies and the potential opportunities they might introduce. The 
framework has been predominantly set up to evaluate distributed PV, 
BESS, and EVs. In this collaboration between NREL and BRPL, we developed
 and evaluated the framework on two distribution feeders in the BRPL 
territory for various scenarios of BESS and EVs. BESS are evaluated for 
their effectiveness on the grid to mitigate present and future feeder 
overloading scenarios, and they are subsequently analyzed for their 
costs compared to the costs of traditional upgradation measures. 
Scenarios include assessing the effects of EV density on grid 
infrastructure upgrades and interlinking EV management with BESS 
integration.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In 2021, an average of 5.5 generators were connected every day
 in Brazilian MV distribution systems, and 98.9% of these generators are
 photovoltaic. The increased penetration of MV distributed generation 
has been accompanied by a rise in the workload of utility planning 
engineers, who must study and propose solutions to enable the connection
 of every MV generator. In this context, this work proposes a quick 
first-assessment approach to identify if the required connection can be 
approved or if further studies are required. The proposed approach 
focuses on the most restrictive steady-state technical impacts 
(overvoltage and overload) related to the increased penetration of MV 
distributed generators. The proposed approach consists of building 
connection assessment diagrams that can successfully speed up the 
required analyses and, consequently, decrease person-hour costs.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper develops a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to 
solve a cooperative, multi-agent Volt-Var Control (VVC) problem for high
 solar penetration distribution systems. The ingenuity of our RL method 
lies in a novel two-stage progressive training strategy that can 
effectively improve training speed and convergence of the machine 
learning algorithm. In Stage 1 (individual training), while holding all 
the other agents inactive, we separately train each agent to obtain its 
own optimal VVC actions in the action space: consume, generate, 
do-nothing. In Stage 2 (cooperative training), all agents are trained 
again coordinately to share VVC responsibility. Rewards and costs in our
 RL scheme include (i) a system-level reward (for taking an action), 
(ii) an agent-level reward (for doing-nothing), and (iii) an agent-level
 action cost function. This new framework allows rewards to be 
dynamically allocated to each agent based on their contribution while 
accounting for the trade-off between control effectiveness and action 
cost. The proposed methodology is tested and validated in a modified 
IEEE 123-bus system using realistic PV and load profiles. Simulation 
results confirm that the proposed approach is robust, and 
computationally efficient and achieves desirable volt-var control 
performance under a wide range of operation conditions.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Local energy markets are emerging as a tool for coordinating 
generation, storage, and consumption of energy from distributed 
resources. In combination with automation, they promise to provide an 
effective energy management framework that is fair and brings 
system-level savings. The cooperative–competitive nature of energy 
markets calls for multi-agent based automation with learning energy 
trading agents. However, depending on the dynamics of the 
agent–environment interaction, this approach may yield unintended 
behavior of market participants. Thus, the design of market mechanisms 
suitable for reinforcement learning agents must take into account this 
interplay. This article introduces autonomous local energy exchange 
(ALEX) as an experimental framework that combines multi-agent learning 
and double auction mechanism. Participants determine their internal 
price signals and make energy management decisions through market 
interactions, rather than relying on predetermined external price 
signals. The main contribution of this article is examination of 
compatibility between specific market elements and independent learning 
agents. Effects of different market properties are evaluated through 
simulation experiments, and the results are used for determine a 
suitable market design. The results show that market truthfulness 
maintains demand-response functionality, while weak budget balancing 
provides a strong reinforcement signal for the learning agents. The 
resulting agent behavior is compared with two baselines: net billing and
 time-of-use rates. The ALEX-based pricing is more responsive to 
fluctuations in the community net load compared to the time-of-use. The 
more accurate accounting of renewable energy usage reduced bills by a 
median 38.8% compared to net billing, confirming the ability to better 
facilitate demand response.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Over the past century, US electric grid has evolved into an 
extremely complex and large interconnected grid identified by the 
National Academy of Engineers (NAE) as the greatest engineering 
achievement of the century. During that period, the overwhelming 
accepted principle was “larger or bigger the better”. The AC 
transmission voltage went up to 765 kV and the individual generating 
units were in excess of 1,000 MW. This centralized generation model was 
considered to be efficient and reliable way to operate the grid. This 
grid continued to serve the nation well. It, however, faced serious 
challenges with the demands of the 21st century that will require high 
penetration of renewable energy, environmental impact of large power 
plants, global warming and climate change, carbon emission and global 
energy sustainability. New approach had to be taken to adopt the new 
regulatory policies. Emerging trends such as low-cost natural gas, 
increased deployment of renewable energy technologies in distribution, 
and continued evolution of electricity markets are transforming the ways
 to generate and deliver electricity. Other factors such as 
environmental policies to reduce the carbon footprint, maximize the 
energy efficiency by utilizing the distributed based renewable energy 
generation also influence the future grid structure. Aging 
infrastructure combined with the growth and the evolving de-centralized 
model will have significant impact on the future grid’s ability to 
provide the electricity more efficiently, reliably, with higher 
resiliency. This dissertation is divided into two parts: (1) to achieve 
greater resiliency, it proposes an integrated T\&amp;D co-simulation 
framework that considers the effects of Distributed Energy Resources 
(DER) in the distribution. (2) to achieve greater reliability, improved 
system protection is needed at the distribution level that considers the
 DER affect such as two-way power flow, low fault currents, etc. This 
dissertation proposes and analyzes the travelling-wave (TW) based 
protection at the distribution level. Integrated T\&amp;D framework and 
the TW based protection improves the grid to be more reliable and 
resilient.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Smart meters have been deployed for replacing 
electromechanical energy meters around the world. As these new devices 
have the capability to transmit information, utilities seek for new 
applications and functionalities to add value for the new meters. In 
this context, this paper presents a method for customer rephasing using 
measurements of active and reactive powers acquired from customers' 
smart meters. The main purposes of such an application are to reduce 
feeders' technical losses and voltage unbalance. A representative 
express feeder from a Brazilian utility is utilized as a test system. 
Results show that the proposed method can reduce 33% of technical losses
 and up to 80% of the voltage unbalance in the system. Additionally, the
 probabilistic assessment shows that the method performance is robust to
 missing data, e.g., its efficiency is not impacted for cases when 
reactive power measurements are not available.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Distribution network reconfiguration, as a part of the 
distribution management system, plays an important role in increasing 
the energy efficiency of the distribution network by coordinating the 
operations of the switches in the distribution network. Dynamic 
distribution network reconfiguration (DDNR), enabled by the sufficient 
number of remote switching devices in the distribution network, attempts
 to find the optimal topologies of the distribution network over the 
specified time interval. This paper proposes data-driven DDNR based on 
deep reinforcement learning (DRL). DRL-based DDNR controller aims to 
minimize the objective function, i.e. active energy losses and the cost 
of switching manipulations while satisfying the constraints. The 
following constraints are considered: allowed bus voltages, allowed line
 apparent powers, a radial network configuration with all buses being 
supplied, and the maximal allowed number of switching operations. This 
optimization problem is modelled as a Markov decision process by 
defining the possible states and actions of the DDNR agent (controller) 
and rewards that lead the agent to minimize the objective function while
 satisfying the constraints. Switching operation constraints are 
modelled by modifying the action space definition instead of including 
the additional penalty term in the reward function, to increase the 
computational efficiency. The proposed algorithm was tested on three 
test examples: small benchmark network, real-life large-scale test 
system and IEEE 33-bus radial system, and the results confirmed the 
robustness and scalability of the proposed algorithm.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>The City of Los Angeles has set ambitious goals to transform 
its electricity supply, aiming to achieve a 100% renewable energy power 
system by 2045, along with aggressive electrification targets for 
buildings and vehicles. To reach these goals, and assess the 
implications for jobs, electricity rates, the environment, and 
environmental justice, the Los Angeles City Council passed a series of 
motions directing the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) 
to determine the technical feasibility and investment pathways of a 100%
 renewable energy portfolio standard. The Los Angeles 100% Renewable 
Energy Study (LA100) is a first-of-its-kind objective, rigorous, and 
science-based power systems analysis to determine what investments could
 be made to achieve these goals. The LA100 final report is presented as a
 collection of 12 chapters and an executive summary, each of which is

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>A modeling framework integrating both building energy modeling
 and power system modeling is introduced for the design of net zero 
energy (NZE) districts for the simultaneous selection of both 
demand-side efficiency measures and supply-side generation technologies.
 A novel district control scheme is proposed for pursuing NZE on a 
subhourly basis while mitigating potential grid impacts such as power 
backfeeding and voltage violations. As a case study, Peña Station NEXT, a
 new 100-building, mixed-use district on a 1200-node distribution feeder
 in Denver, Colorado, is modeled in the integrated framework. An 
exhaustive scenario analysis is conducted for sizing the district's 
distributed energy resources, considering multiple objectives such as 
capital cost, net energy import, and equipment violations. When trying 
to achieve annual NZE, the district incurs frequent operating 
violations, and achieving NZE on a 15-min basis is also limited by 
seasonal fluctuations in photovoltaic output, illustrating the need for 
diverse generation or seasonal storage. As a practical compromise, both 
annual and 15-min district import can be reduced by ∼78% without 
significant violations.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>To enhance the cyber-resilience and security of the smart grid
 against malicious attacks and system errors, we present 
software-defined networking (SDN)-based communication architecture 
design for smart grid operation. Our design utilizes SDN technology, 
which improves network manageability, and provides application-oriented 
visibility and direct programmability, to deploy the multiple SDN-aware 
applications to enhance grid security and resilience including 
optimization-based network management to recover Phasor Measurement Unit
 (PMU) network connectivity and restore power system observability; 
Flow-based anomaly detection and optimization-based network management 
to mitigate Manipulation of demand of IoT (MadIoT) attack. We also 
developed a prototype system in a cyber-physical testbed and conducted 
extensive evaluation experiments using the IEEE 30-bus system, IEEE 
118-bus system, and IIT campus microgrid.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>An increase in Electric Vehicles (EV) will result in higher 
demands on the distribution electric power systems (EPS) which may 
result in thermal line overloading and low voltage violations. To 
understand the impact, this work simulates two EV charging scenarios 
(home- and work-dominant) under potential 2030 EV adoption levels on 10 
actual distribution feeders that support residential, commercial, and 
industrial loads. The simulations include actual driving patterns of 
existing (non-EV) vehicles taken from global positioning system (GPS) 
data. The GPS driving behaviors, which explain the spatial and temporal 
EV charging demands, provide information on each vehicles travel 
distance, dwell locations, and dwell durations. Then, the EPS 
simulations incorporate the EV charging demands to calculate the power 
flow across the feeder. Simulation results show that voltage impacts are
 modest (less than 0.01 p.u.), likely due to robust feeder designs and 
the models only represent the high-voltage (“primary”) system 
components. Line loading impacts are more noticeable, with a maximum 
increase of about 15%. Additionally, the feeder peak load times 
experience a slight shift for residential and mixed feeders (≈1 h), not 
at all for the industrial, and 8 h for the commercial feeder.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This report presents an analytical methodology to identify 
alternative options to manage interconnection costs and streamline 
interconnection timelines for distribution system-connected photovoltaic
 (PV) systems not co-located with load. Specifically, the report details
 the methodology and results of an analysis that: 1. Identifies 
potential grid violations that would be induced by a PV system 
requesting interconnection to a distribution circuit; 2. Identifies 
multiple technically viable options for mitigating the potential 
violations, including infrastructure upgrades, downsizing the PV system 
size, curtailment of PV, and addition of battery energy storage; 3. 
Defines the required technical operating parameters of the system in 
order to mitigate all potential violations (the "Operating Envelope"); 
4. Compares the economics of each option, from the PV developer's 
perspective. The analysis supports the ongoing evolution of 
interconnection standards for combined PV and energy storage systems by 
providing a methodology to define allowable maximum export limits during
 each hour. The methodology presented could be used by utilities as part
 of the interconnection study process, to inform negotiations with DER 
developers and the drafting of mutually acceptable interconnection 
agreements. The resulting technical operating parameters could be 
included as part of the interconnection service agreement (ISA) between 
the system owner and the utility company. The companion report to this 
analysis, Gill et al. (2022), details the envisioned framework for the 
implementation of the technical operating parameters.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This project is aimed at creating a transactive energy market 
to address the challenges faced by utility providers when increasing 
distributed energy resource (DER) adoption in their service area. One 
major challenge is mitigating export back to the grid during times of 
excess production. The transactive energy market operates at the 
distribution level and balances the supply and demand on the feeder, 
thus maintaining a zero-energy export at the primary feeder head. The 
market participants in this case are the residential customers on the 
feeder, who bid into the market. Building controls are then optimized 
based on the settled price. Market performance was demonstrated in this 
study by simulating different levels of DER penetration on a selected 
Pepco feeder. The feeder successfully achieved a zero export while 
providing cost-effective electricity to the participants, demonstrating 
that this market design can enable high DER penetration on existing 
feeders.</td>
