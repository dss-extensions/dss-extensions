This paper proposes an approach to periodically build, a validated {OpenDSS} distribution network model for network planning, converting electric elements of Geographic Information System to Common Information Model files, which can be used to feed Distribution System Management and {OpenDSS} platforms, closing gaps between these two systems. The proposal enables a fast conversion of 100\% of a distribution network, reducing time for decision making and giving more robustness to planning studies and further analysis. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in creating suitable and open-source network models, with high accuracy, for a variety of studies for network planning helping Smart Grid implementation and power quality enhancements.},

Consequently, the {EV} charging market players is a concept that is receiving particular attention, in which the charging station operator ({CPO}) is the player responsible for the infrastructure of the public {EV} charging stations ({EVCSs}). On the other hand, the integration of distributed energy resources ({DER}) and {EVs} within the electrical system requires the development of algorithms that allow {CPOs} to manage renewable energy sources aiming to serve {EV} charging. Internet of Things ({IoT}) makes it possible to develop an {IoT} platform that can help with the integration of a smart charging algorithm with the {CPO}. In this paper, a characterization of the {IoT}-middleware {DOJOT} platform (developed by the Brazilian research center {CPqD}) combined with two softwares developed under a Brazilian R\&D project has been realized. The software under development aims to generate monthly policies for price variation and power limits for {EVCSs} and to perform smart charging of {EVs} considering {DERs}. Additionally, The evaluation was made through the performance of the {DOJOT} {IoT} platform and the software according to the number of devices that must be processed, internet connection quality, and multiprocessing.},

The increased penetration of {MV} distributed generation has been accompanied by a rise in the workload of utility planning engineers, who must study and propose solutions to enable the connection of every {MV} generator. In this context, this work proposes a quick first-assessment approach to identify if the required connection can be approved or if further studies are required. The proposed approach focuses on the most restrictive steady-state technical impacts (overvoltage and overload) related to the increased penetration of {MV} distributed generators. The proposed approach consists of building connection assessment diagrams that can successfully speed up the required analyses and, consequently, decrease person-hour costs.},

As these new devices have the capability to transmit information, utilities seek for new applications and functionalities to add value for the new meters. In this context, this paper presents a method for customer rephasing using measurements of active and reactive powers acquired from customers' smart meters. The main purposes of such an application are to reduce feeders' technical losses and voltage unbalance. A representative express feeder from a Brazilian utility is utilized as a test system. Results show that the proposed method can reduce 33\% of technical losses and up to 80\% of the voltage unbalance in the system. Additionally, the probabilistic assessment shows that the method performance is robust to missing data, e.g., its efficiency is not impacted for cases when reactive power measurements are not available.},

This paper models a real-life feeder with a high penetration level of solar photovoltaic ({PV}) units in detail including the secondary circuits, and shows a large voltage swell in one of the non-faulted phases of the feeder during a single line to ground fault. The voltages seen during this swell are more than 1.2 p.u., which can have detrimental impacts on the connected equipment and can also lead to loss of connected generation. The reason for this voltage swell is found to be the equivalent impedance at the fault location resulting from the ratio of zero and positive sequence cable impedances. It is seen that the connected solar {PV} units with appropriate control are able to reduce the severity of the voltage swell, especially for higher penetration levels of solar {PV} considered, but not entirely eliminate it.},

By its attractive features such as fast response and decreasing price, the {ESS} can be used in various scenarios in the electrical system. Among them, we highlight the profit from the purchase and sale of electricity and the improvement of the voltage profile. The objective of this work is to evaluate the operation of the storage system by using the Multi-objective Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization ({MEPSO}) to perform energy arbitrage and jointly improve the voltage profile of the network. The {MEPSO} is used to find a set of operational decisions to buy or store energy using the prices of the Day-Ahead Market ({DAM}) and, within these decisions, to operate the {ESS} during the Real-Time Market ({RTM}) hours. The results are promising and evidence that, through the proposed methodology, it is possible to perform energy arbitrage with the improvement of the voltage profile and a low number of charging/discharging cycles.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in technology and financial costs reduction are allowing an anticipated insertion of Battery Energy Storage Systems ({BESSs}) in the low-voltage ({LV}) distribution systems, especially in customers owning a photovoltaic ({PV}) generation system. On the other hand, utilities are also installing medium-size {BESSs} on {LV} systems to assist in system operation. This massive integration of medium and small-sized {BESS} into {PV}-rich {LV} systems can create adverse impacts on the circuit operation as each {BESS} can operate with a different control mode, with different control settings. Therefore, since there are distinct control modes of operation, it is necessary to analyze them and how their parametrization and combined operation affect the grid indices. The parametrization and impacts of multiple {BESS} operating in an {LV} system are investigated in this paper through quasi-static time series simulations on a real {LV} gated community network with high {PV} penetration. The results reveal the need for properly coordinating the operation of the multiple {BESS}, otherwise, operating indices of the grid may deteriorate significantly.},

Thus, efficient simulation tools that can predict the {EV} operation and deployment are significant assets for charging point operators ({CPOs}), electric mobility service providers ({EMSPs}), charging service providers ({CSPs}) and electricity companies. In this paper, an algorithm for simulating the utilization and availability of public {EV} charging stations ({CSs}) has been developed. Based on several {EV} user features, the proposed algorithm generates realistic scenarios of {CS} availability, utilization, and impact over the distribution network via {AC} power flows. Moreover, the impact of considering smart charging (i.e., remote {CS} power limit control) and price policies is also modeled by the proposed algorithm. With these enhancements, the proposed simulation tool is used to predict the aggregated behavior of a population of {EV} users within the vicinity of two real distribution feeders. Results show the capacity of the proposed algorithm to generate realistic {CS} utilization statistics subject to different smart charging and price policies.},

When it comes to distribution networks, the problem is especially challenging due to the non-homogeneous characteristics and unique topology of each feeder. This paper presents a method based on gated graph neural network for automatic fault localization on distribution networks. The method aggregates problem data in a graph, where the feeder topology is represented by the graph links and nodes attributes can encapsulate any selected information such as operated devices, electrical characteristics and measurements at the point. The main advantage of the proposed solution is that it is immune to network reconfiguration and allows the use of a single trained model on multiple feeders. An experiment was conducted with faults simulated on 10 different feeders, all of them based on actual distribution feeders. The results shows that the model is able to generalize the correlations learned on training to correctly predict the fault region in most cases, even on a feeder it has not seen before.},

By comparing our method against such myopic techniques on real distribution systems, we show that our algorithm is able to reduce the overall integration costs by looking at future decisions.

	abstract = {Energy management of transmission and distribution networks (T\&D) is becoming more challenging with the accelerated adoption of distributed energy resources ({DERs})-such as distributed photovoltaic generation and battery energy storage systems ({BESS})-on the electric grid. To better analyze the impacts of {DERs} on both transmission and distribution systems, a comprehensive T\&D co-simulation platform is developed. Further, with {DERs} more actively participating in system operation-e.g., by providing real-time grid services-their cyber vulnerability needs to be better understood to maintain system reliability. This paper discusses a cyber-physical events emulation-based T\&D co-simulation platform to perform comprehensive cyber events emulations, physical simulation, and analysis of interdependent impacts. Results from the case studies-which show how cyber events on a synthetic distribution network can impact operations on the transmission and distribution network-validate that the proposed T\&D cosimulation platform can perform cyber-physical events emulation and produce response in near realtime; therefore, with extensive simulation using the proposed co-simulation platform, the system operators can accumulate adequate training data for system situational awareness of grid anomalies.},

	abstract = {Over the past century, {US} electric grid has evolved into an extremely complex and large interconnected grid identified by the National Academy of Engineers ({NAE}) as the greatest engineering achievement of the century. During that period, the overwhelming accepted principle was “larger or bigger the better”. The {AC} transmission voltage went up to 765 {kV} and the individual generating units were in excess of 1,000 {MW}. This centralized generation model was considered to be efficient and reliable way to operate the grid. This grid continued to serve the nation well. It, however, faced serious challenges with the demands of the 21st century that will require high penetration of renewable energy, environmental impact of large power plants, global warming and climate change, carbon emission and global energy sustainability. New approach had to be taken to adopt the new regulatory policies. Emerging trends such as low-cost natural gas, increased deployment of renewable energy technologies in distribution, and continued evolution of electricity markets are transforming the ways to generate and deliver electricity. Other factors such as environmental policies to reduce the carbon footprint, maximize the energy efficiency by utilizing the distributed based renewable energy generation also influence the future grid structure. Aging infrastructure combined with the growth and the evolving de-centralized model will have significant impact on the future grid’s ability to provide the electricity more efficiently, reliably, with higher resiliency. This dissertation is divided into two parts: (1) to achieve greater resiliency, it proposes an integrated T{\textbackslash}\&D co-simulation framework that considers the effects of Distributed Energy Resources ({DER}) in the distribution. (2) to achieve greater reliability, improved system protection is needed at the distribution level that considers the {DER} affect such as two-way power flow, low fault currents, etc. This dissertation proposes and analyzes the travelling-wave ({TW}) based protection at the distribution level. Integrated T{\textbackslash}\&D framework and the {TW} based protection improves the grid to be more reliable and resilient.},

	abstract = {The increase in the photovoltaic generation on distribution grids may create problems, such as voltage-violations. To gain situational awareness for system operation, e.g., adjusting the tap-settings of the transformers or adjust capacitor banks, utilities need situational awareness about locations and amounts of photovoltaic powers being generated in different feeders. Unfortunately, many utilities not only lack observability of the distribution grid, e.g., no secondary grid schematics but also have no situational awareness on which feeders solar panels locate. To understand where the solar users are roughly, we propose to use the feeder measurements from utilities with solar panel measurements from third-party solar companies. Due to the property of active correlation detection, we propose several sequentially improved methods based on quantitative association rule mining ({QARM}), where we also provide a lower bound for performance guarantees based on the amount of available data and the size of the bin for clustering. However, the binning of data leads to information loss. So, we design a band to replace bin for creating a new data mining approach for robustness. We validate our result for the {IEEE} 4-, 8-, 123-, 8500-bus cases with the Pecan-Street dataset, and also for the {IEEE} 123-bus case under low/high penetration and with radial/weakly meshed configurations. For realistic validation, we also obtain real data from a utility and a solar power company in the same zip codes in a city of California. Numerical results show accurate associations of feeders and solar panels, leading to increased situational awareness of the secondary distribution grids.},

However, power flow models for these networks are rare due to the complexity to collect and manage large amounts of feeder data in a way that suits engineering analysis. Unfortunately, even the network model exists, the quality of data may not be high enough for power flow analysis. In this paper, a comprehensive 4-wire low-voltage network is built, starting from reliable topology and approximate sequence impedances, and simulation results are compared to the uncleaned data and a simplified 3-wire representation. Power flow with photovoltaic penetration is also carried out. Results indicate that the improved network data has a higher occurrence of undervoltage situations. Using a 4-wire network with neutral wire can more accurately reflect the influence of neutral-to-ground voltage, even in the presence of frequent grounding. Both undervoltage and overvoltage deteriorate with {PV} penetration due to neutral voltage fluctuation.},

To understand the impact, this work simulates two {EV} charging scenarios (home- and work-dominant) under potential 2030 {EV} adoption levels on 10 actual distribution feeders that support residential, commercial, and industrial loads. The simulations include actual driving patterns of existing (non-{EV}) vehicles taken from global positioning system ({GPS}) data. The {GPS} driving behaviors, which explain the spatial and temporal {EV} charging demands, provide information on each vehicles travel distance, dwell locations, and dwell durations. Then, the {EPS} simulations incorporate the {EV} charging demands to calculate the power flow across the feeder. Simulation results show that voltage impacts are modest (less than 0.01 p.u.), likely due to robust feeder designs and the models only represent the high-voltage (“primary”) system components. Line loading impacts are more noticeable, with a maximum increase of about 15\%. Additionally, the feeder peak load times experience a slight shift for residential and mixed feeders (≈1 h), not at all for the industrial, and 8 h for the commercial feeder.},

One major challenge is mitigating export back to the grid during times of excess production. The transactive energy market operates at the distribution level and balances the supply and demand on the feeder, thus maintaining a zero-energy export at the primary feeder head. The market participants in this case are the residential customers on the feeder, who bid into the market. Building controls are then optimized based on the settled price. Market performance was demonstrated in this study by simulating different levels of {DER} penetration on a selected Pepco feeder.

The ingenuity of our {RL} method lies in a novel two-stage progressive training strategy that can effectively improve training speed and convergence of the machine learning algorithm. In Stage 1 (individual training), while holding all the other agents inactive, we separately train each agent to obtain its own optimal {VVC} actions in the action space: consume, generate, do-nothing. In Stage 2 (cooperative training), all agents are trained again coordinately to share {VVC} responsibility. Rewards and costs in our {RL} scheme include (i) a system-level reward (for taking an action), (ii) an agent-level reward (for doing-nothing), and (iii) an agent-level action cost function. This new framework allows rewards to be dynamically allocated to each agent based on their contribution while accounting for the trade-off between control effectiveness and action cost. The proposed methodology is tested and validated in a modified {IEEE} 123-bus system using realistic {PV} and load profiles. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach is robust, and computationally efficient and achieves desirable volt-var control performance under a wide range of operation conditions.},

	abstract = {Distributed photovoltaic systems can cause adverse distribution system impacts, including voltage violations at customer locations and thermal overload of lines, transformers, and other equipment resulting from high current. The installed capacity at which violations first occur and above which would require system upgrades is called the hosting capacity. Current static methods for determining hosting capacity tend to either consider infrequent worst-case snapshots in time and/or capture coarse time and spatial resolution. Because the duration of violations cannot be captured with these traditional methods, the metric thresholds used in these studies conservatively use the strictest constraints given in operating standards, even though both worse voltage performance and higher overloads may be temporarily acceptable. However, assessing the full details requires accurately capturing time-dependence, voltage-regulating equipment operations, and performance of advanced controls-based mitigation techniques. In this paper, we propose a dynamic distributed photovoltaic hosting capacity methodology to address these issues by conducting power flow analysis for a full year. A key contribution is the formulation of time aware metrics to take these annual results and identify the hosting capacity. Through a case study, we show that this approach can more fully capture grid impacts of distributed photovoltaic than traditional methods and the dynamic hosting capacity was 60\%–200\% higher than the static hosting capacity in this case study.},

	abstract = {Distribution network reconfiguration, as a part of the distribution management system, plays an important role in increasing the energy efficiency of the distribution network by coordinating the operations of the switches in the distribution network. Dynamic distribution network reconfiguration ({DDNR}), enabled by the sufficient number of remote switching devices in the distribution network, attempts to find the optimal topologies of the distribution network over the specified time interval. This paper proposes data-driven {DDNR} based on deep reinforcement learning ({DRL}). {DRL}-based {DDNR} controller aims to minimize the objective function, i.e. active energy losses and the cost of switching manipulations while satisfying the constraints. The following constraints are considered: allowed bus voltages, allowed line apparent powers, a radial network configuration with all buses being supplied, and the maximal allowed number of switching operations. This optimization problem is modelled as a Markov decision process by defining the possible states and actions of the {DDNR} agent (controller) and rewards that lead the agent to minimize the objective function while satisfying the constraints. Switching operation constraints are modelled by modifying the action space definition instead of including the additional penalty term in the reward function, to increase the computational efficiency. The proposed algorithm was tested on three test examples: small benchmark network, real-life large-scale test system and {IEEE} 33-bus radial system, and the results confirmed the robustness and scalability of the proposed algorithm.},

We derive a quasi-steady state system model, modeling the progression of phasors as a martingale and describing the input sensitivity with the linearization of the unbalanced three phase power flow manifold for the Thevenin equivalent circuit. We establish the convexity of the stable linear feedback matrix region, and investigate the stability of Single Input Single Output Phasor Control ({SISOPC}) with gains chosen based on the reactance of the Thevenin equivalent circuit. To improve upon {SISOPC}, we propose the Linear Quadratic Phasor Controller ({LQPC}), which generates a multiple input multiple output linear feedback matrix which takes into account both the network resistance and the mutual impedances that couple the unbalanced three phase injections. We demonstrate the performance of the {LQPC} using {OpenDSS} simulations on an unbalanced three phase distribution network, demonstrating the effectiveness of the {LQPC}.},

Specifically, the report details the methodology and results of an analysis that: 1. Identifies potential grid violations that would be induced by a {PV} system requesting interconnection to a distribution circuit; 2. Identifies multiple technically viable options for mitigating the potential violations, including infrastructure upgrades, downsizing the {PV} system size, curtailment of {PV}, and addition of battery energy storage; 3. Defines the required technical operating parameters of the system in order to mitigate all potential violations (the "Operating Envelope"); 4. Compares the economics of each option, from the {PV} developer's perspective. The analysis supports the ongoing evolution of interconnection standards for combined {PV} and energy storage systems by providing a methodology to define allowable maximum export limits during each hour. The methodology presented could be used by utilities as part of the interconnection study process, to inform negotiations with {DER} developers and the drafting of mutually acceptable interconnection agreements. The resulting technical operating parameters could be included as part of the interconnection service agreement ({ISA}) between the system owner and the utility company. The companion report to this analysis, Gill et al. (2022), details the envisioned framework for the implementation of the technical operating parameters.},

The recent development in inverter technologies provides the opportunity to develop control systems to realize effective {PV} governance, and thus, to improve dynamic {PV} hosting capacity for distribution grids. In this article, a novel distributed energy resource management system ({DERMS}) solution is proposed by adopting the real-time optimal power flow approach for coordinated control of the distributed {PV} inverters. The proposed approach eliminates the dependence on load knowledge via measurement feedback correction, and it can be implemented in real time. One challenge is that the technique is sensitive to the data availability and integrity of voltage measurements. Therefore, a decentralized {DERMS} approach is developed by leveraging the concepts of state estimation. The framework and the effectiveness of the solution approach are numerically demonstrated on a real distribution feeder in Southern California.},

	abstract = {Optimal power flow ({OPF}) problems, which dispatch power targets to controllable generating units across a network, must generally account for non-convex constraints on power flow. Adapting those problems so as to make them solvable with convex optimization techniques is an area of much academic and operational interest. In this paper, we present a method for solving {OPF} as a quadratic program by iteratively refining and re-initializing a linearized model of power flow based on the outputs of an associated nonlinear solver. The linear model on which we demonstrate this method is an adapted version of an approximation designed for use with unbalanced distribution networks. As an important benefit, the model allows for the explicit inclusion of nodal voltage phasor values in both the {OPF} problem's objective and its constraints, which opens the door to the idea of phasor-based control ({PBC}) design. We show in simulations on the {IEEE} 13-node test feeder that our method quickly converges to a set of phasor targets that are sufficiently precise for use in operations at the distribution level.},

Accordingly, a new case study is developed to show the gaps and challenges at different {PV} penetration levels in {LVDNs}. In this case study, the aim is to provide a better understanding of {LVDNs}’ behavior in order to support the development and validation of the models and tools. Therefore, a reduction model is proposed to decrease the simulation time by lowering the number of buses in the {IEEE} European {LV} Test Feeder, with a negligible error. In addition, an {OpenDSS}-Julia interface is developed to demonstrate the effects of different {PV} penetration levels on the inverters’ behavior, active power curtailment, and voltage level in {LVDNs}. Results are demonstrated concerning several limitations and challenges in using existing smart inverter control techniques, in terms of the inverters’ behavior, active power curtailment, and the voltage level. These limitations and challenges include over-voltage issues using the constant power factor technique, high active power curtailment using the volt–watt technique, and high current flows in the network assets and poor power factors using the volt–var technique. In addition, state-of-the-art system models have not taken-into-account the modeling of uncertainty effects on the performance of {PV} modules. Similarly, such models have largely ignored the internal and standby losses in the inverter models. These neglected issues may lead to under- or over-estimation of the impacts of {PV} systems on {LVDNs} and inaccurate estimations of the network’s ability to accommodate high {PV} penetration levels.},

An exhaustive scenario analysis is conducted for sizing the district's distributed energy resources, considering multiple objectives such as capital cost, net energy import, and equipment violations. When trying to achieve annual {NZE}, the district incurs frequent operating violations, and achieving {NZE} on a 15-min basis is also limited by seasonal fluctuations in photovoltaic output, illustrating the need for diverse generation or seasonal storage. As a practical compromise, both annual and 15-min district import can be reduced by ∼78\% without significant violations.},

Changes in demand profiles require improvements in distribution system load models, which have not historically accounted for device controllability or impacts on customer comfort. Although building modeling research has focused on these features, there is a need to incorporate them into distribution load models that include {DERs} and can be used to study grid-interactive buildings. In this paper, we present the Object-oriented, Controllable, High-resolution Residential Energy ({OCHRE}) model. {OCHRE} is a controllable thermal-electric residential energy model that captures building thermal dynamics, integrates grid-dependent electrical behavior, contains models for common {DERs} and end-use loads, and simulates at a time resolution down to 1 minute. It includes models for space heaters, air conditioners, water heaters, electric vehicles, photovoltaics, and batteries that are externally controllable and integrated in a co-simulation framework. Using a proposed zero energy ready community in Colorado, we co-simulate a distribution grid and 498 all-electric homes with a diverse set of efficiency levels and equipment properties. We show that controllable devices can reduce peak demand within a neighborhood by up to 73\% during a critical peak period without sacrificing occupant comfort. We also demonstrate the importance of modeling load diversity at a high time resolution when quantifying power and voltage fluctuations across a distribution system.},

	abstract = {Local energy markets are emerging as a tool for coordinating generation, storage, and consumption of energy from distributed resources. In combination with automation, they promise to provide an effective energy management framework that is fair and brings system-level savings. The cooperative–competitive nature of energy markets calls for multi-agent based automation with learning energy trading agents. However, depending on the dynamics of the agent–environment interaction, this approach may yield unintended behavior of market participants. Thus, the design of market mechanisms suitable for reinforcement learning agents must take into account this interplay. This article introduces autonomous local energy exchange ({ALEX}) as an experimental framework that combines multi-agent learning and double auction mechanism. Participants determine their internal price signals and make energy management decisions through market interactions, rather than relying on predetermined external price signals. The main contribution of this article is examination of compatibility between specific market elements and independent learning agents. Effects of different market properties are evaluated through simulation experiments, and the results are used for determine a suitable market design. The results show that market truthfulness maintains demand-response functionality, while weak budget balancing provides a strong reinforcement signal for the learning agents. The resulting agent behavior is compared with two baselines: net billing and time-of-use rates. The {ALEX}-based pricing is more responsive to fluctuations in the community net load compared to the time-of-use. The more accurate accounting of renewable energy usage reduced bills by a median 38.8\% compared to net billing, confirming the ability to better facilitate demand response.},

	abstract = {Emerging distributed energy resources ({DERs})—such as solar photovoltaics ({PV}), battery energy storage systems ({BESS}), and electric vehicles ({EVs})—are expected to increase substantially in India in the coming years following policy-driven targets of the Government of India to modernize its electricity system, reduce greenhouse gas emissions ({GHGs}), and improve air quality. These emerging technologies can pose challenges to distribution utilities, forcing overhauls in planning and operational practices. They can also create challenges in power system infrastructure planning and cause more frequent system operational violations (e.g., network voltage bounds and loading thresholds) if not properly integrated. The impacts on the localized power distribution grid from these emerging technologies manifest in increased infrastructure investments and erratic shifts in demand patterns. These impacts are not yet well understood, and analytic solutions are not readily available. To address these challenges, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ({NREL}), in collaboration with {BSES} Rajdhani Power Ltd. ({BRPL}), developed an advanced power distribution system impact analysis framework of {BRPL}’s distribution system. This framework helps analyze the readiness of the power distribution network to accommodate emerging technologies and the potential opportunities they might introduce. The framework has been predominantly set up to evaluate distributed {PV}, {BESS}, and {EVs}. In this collaboration between {NREL} and {BRPL}, we developed and evaluated the framework on two distribution feeders in the {BRPL} territory for various scenarios of {BESS} and {EVs}. {BESS} are evaluated for their effectiveness on the grid to mitigate present and future feeder overloading scenarios, and they are subsequently analyzed for their costs compared to the costs of traditional upgradation measures. Scenarios include assessing the effects of {EV} density on grid infrastructure upgrades and interlinking {EV} management with {BESS} integration.},

	title = {Cyber Risk Analysis and Threat Mitigation Strategies Against Distributed Energy Resources and Internet of Things Infrastructure Attacks},
	abstract = {Distributed Energy Resources penetration levels continue to increase across distribution networks, producing a wide variety of challenges for system operators. Creating among others, the need for new or improved methods that can manage their output characteristics. This has led to regulatory amendments that are expected to facilitate secure grid operations while continuing to enable increasing levels of Distributed Energy Resources penetration. However, it is still unclear if these systems will behave as intended in the presence of a cyber attack.To address this fundamental question, this work presents a detailed cybersecurity analysis on Distributed Energy Resources and Internet of Things infrastructure, covering a wide variety of angles from assessing device-level vulnerabilities to proposing methods/metrics that can quantify risk at the system-level. In addition, this work introduces two, fully-virtualized cyber-physical testbeds that have been envisioned for cyber-security researchers. It is expected that these software-based tools can aid to develop better, more secure Internet of Things and Distributed Energy Resource-based deployments.Furthermore, methods for ensuring correct operation at the device-level and distribution system-level are presented. In specific, a Trusted Execution Environment solution, which relies on hardware-level process isolation has been developed to provide digital-attestation services on analog inputs. The final contribution of this work is the development of a distributed fail-safe method for managing Volt-Var operations. The proposed method combines local voltage information (from independent agents) and simplified network models to determine the expected voltage output before actually executing the command using consensus-voting techniques. The underlying distributed consensus methods and power models work together to ensure that a final decision not only satisfies traditional power system constraints such as security (correctness) and dependability but also availability and partition tolerance under distributed systems theory.},

	title = {Phasor-Based Control on Islanded Networks},
	url = {https://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/techreports/ucb/incoming/EECS-2021-233.pdf},
	abstract = {The advancement of sensing technologies for the power grid has allowed the development
of new strategies for the control of distributed energy resources ({DERs}). In particular, the
emergence of phasor measurement units ({PMUs}) designed for deployment at the distribution
level has presented an exciting opportunity. These {PMUs} have enabled the development of
phasor-based control ({PBC}), a strategy that formulates {DER} power dispatch in terms of
voltage phasor targets to be tracked by local controllers.
This dissertation focuses on the optimal power flow ({OPF}) component of {PBC}’s supervisory
control layer, which has previously been conceptualized and demonstrated in simulation on
distribution networks. We expand its applicability to medium-voltage minigrids and micro-
grids operating in island mode, networks where {PBC} has the potential to deliver important
benefits.
The work is carried out in two stages. After a discussion of {PBC} and other relevant back-
ground topics, we address one of the primary challenges to {PBC} at the medium voltage level:
the need for extreme accuracy in the supervisory controller’s generation of phasor targets.
This accuracy is achieved through an adaptation of an iterative {OPF} methodology that re-
fines a linearized model of power flow through successive exchanges with a nonlinear solver.
We discuss the changes that were made to both linear model and nonlinear solver, as well
as the determination of phasor targets on networks that include tap-changing transformers
and other realistic equipment. The accuracy of the adapted iterative method is then shown
in simulation.
The second stage of the work covers the extension of our {OPF} implementation to islanded
systems. We present a strategy for the treatment of the slack bus used by our nonlinear
solver and apply it to several test cases in simulation. We then analyze a specific case in
2
which our iterative solution method fails, and demonstrate the use of a penalty factor in
our linearized {OPF} formulation as a means of overcoming that failure. A full, end-to-end
implementation of {PBC}’s supervisory layer is then proposed and tested on a number of {DER}
distributions at different feeder penetration levels.
We end with a presentation of data relevant to instrument-transformer-induced error in {PMU}
measurements. This final portion stands alone from the primary work of the dissertation, but
remains highly relevant to {PBC}. From an experimental deployment of two {PMUs} measuring
an identical distribution-grid voltage, we determine a ratio of the errors induced by their
individual potential transformers. Monitoring this quantity over the course of a year allows us
to track the drift in those induced errors over time, motivating a discussion of the expected
impact of error drift on {PBC} and the frequency with which transformers will need to be
recalibrated in operational settings.},

The approach guarantees consistency among scenarios of the same deployment by ensuring that higher penetration scenarios contain {PV} units deployed in lower penetration scenarios. It also constrains the size and spatial distribution of the {PV} plants and considers three placement types. A case study on a real-world distribution system proves that the precepts of scenario consistency, deployment diversity, and placement are met. The study further investigates the impact of the resulting scenarios via a stochastic hosting capacity analysis. Results indicate that the ratio between {PV} and load sizes, referred to as the nodal {PV} penetration factor ({NPPF}), is a key driver of the grid integration impact. By reducing the {NPPF} from 5 to 2, the maximum hosting capacity increased by at least 112\%. The study also reveals that scenarios under random placement can lead to higher hosting capacity values.},

Consumers and prosumers (those who have energy generation resources), however, do not have expertise to engage in repeated P2P trading, and the zero-marginal costs of renewables present challenges in determining fair market prices. To address these issues, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning ({MARL}) framework to help automate consumers' bidding and management of their solar {PV} and energy storage resources, under a specific P2P clearing mechanism that utilizes the so-called supply-demand ratio. In addition, we show how the {MARL} framework can integrate physical network constraints to realize decentralized voltage control, hence ensuring physical feasibility of the P2P energy trading and paving ways for real-world implementations.},

Unfortunately, most existing single-phase {PV} models are focused on the analysis of an individual device, and do not provide a modular circuit model that can be directly integrated into a commercial harmonic power flow simulation tool for large-scale power system studies. In response, this paper derives a single-input single-output harmonic model for single-phase {PVs} that is independent of grid parameters, thus enabling multiple of these devices to be considered simultaneously in system-wide harmonic power flow analyses. The model is validated with electromagnetic transient simulations and then, characterization studies are conducted to determine the expected harmonic impact of these {PV} generators on a real {LV} system. Results demonstrate these devices can increase system damping at typical low order harmonics and are unlikely to introduce new resonances at this frequency range. In addition, it is essential to model the {VSC} controller effect for a more accurate assessment of its harmonic impact.

By representing all loads and generators as constant current consumption/injection, the superposition theorem can be used to calculate the impact of each new {PV} on voltage magnitude and current flows. This approach can be used on a first screening assessment to immediately filter out cases that present no risk of technical violations to the circuit. Only connection requests flagged with risk of violation in this initial screening must be analyzed in detail by specialized engineers. Any type of {PV} connection (single-phase, two-phase, three-phase) in unbalanced multiphase {LV} systems can be analyzed. Extensive validation studies reveal that this approach is conservative, which makes it safe and reliable for quick first screening analyses. Its estimation errors are between 5\% and 18\%.

	abstract = {The massive and widespread rooftop photovoltaic penetration poses new challenges to Distribution System Operators who may need to deal with over and undervoltage problems in the same feeder. To tackle this issue, this work proposes to use the smart inverters from photovoltaic systems to compensate, in real-time, the exact amount of reactive power demanded by the customers to which they are connected. The proposed strategy does not require expensive and complex communication infrastructure, active power curtailment, or inverters oversizing. With a simple infrastructure, it decreases energy losses and the need for capacitor banks. Time-series power-flow simulations are performed in a real distribution system. The results indicate that the proposed strategy of var compensation mitigates more energy losses and voltage transgression than for the cases in which the smart inverters operate with unity power factor, Volt-Watt, or Volt-var control rules.},
