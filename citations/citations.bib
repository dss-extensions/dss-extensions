  abstract = {Due to the increased installation of rooftop PV generators in electric power distribution systems and the intrinsic uncertainties, impact studies require probabilistic methods such as Monte Carlo simulation. An important uncertainty of the Monte Carlo simulation involving rooftop PV systems is the local of installation. Considering all the customer units from the utility database with equal probability for receiving a rooftop PV generator provides unrealistic results. For instance, customers of a building should not receive the same treatment as houses. In this context, to allow more realistic studies, this work presents a methodology for selecting the most probable customer units to install rooftop PV generators considering net metering tariff. The methodology consists of reading a real complete database of a distribution utility, sizing the rooftop PV generators, filtering the customer units with the highest potential to receive a PV generator, and creating the scenarios for the Monte Carlo study. At the end, computational simulations using OpenDSS are carried out in two real distribution networks to illustrate the application of the method.},

  abstract = {An important power quality concern of integrating single-phase photovoltaic (PV) generators to low-voltage (LV) residential systems, is their impact on harmonic distortions due to their power electronic-based interface through a voltage source converter (VSC). Unfortunately, most existing single-phase PV models are focused on the analysis of an individual device, and do not provide a modular circuit model that can be directly integrated into a commercial harmonic power flow simulation tool for large-scale power system studies. In response, this paper derives a single-input single-output harmonic model for single-phase PVs that is independent of grid parameters, thus enabling multiple of these devices to be considered simultaneously in system-wide harmonic power flow analyses. The model is validated with electromagnetic transient simulations and then, characterization studies are conducted to determine the expected harmonic impact of these PV generators on a real LV system. Results demonstrate these devices can increase system damping at typical low order harmonics and are unlikely to introduce new resonances at this frequency range. In addition, it is essential to model the VSC controller effect for a more accurate assessment of its harmonic impact. Sensitivity studies reveal how different VSC parameters affect this behavior.},

One major challenge is mitigating export back to the grid during times of excess production. The transactive energy market operates at the distribution level and balances the supply and demand on the feeder, thus maintaining a zero-energy export at the primary feeder head. The market participants in this case are the residential customers on the feeder, who bid into the market. Building controls are then optimized based on the settled price. Market performance was demonstrated in this study by simulating different levels of DER penetration on a selected Pepco feeder. The feeder successfully achieved a zero export while providing cost-effective electricity to the participants, demonstrating that this market design can enable high DER penetration on existing feeders.},

One of the objectives of the work is to answer the question, “which analysis require T\&D simulation”. To this end, the team held discussions with the utility advisory group (UAG) and identified use cases that are of most interest and studied them in detail. Based on the use cases the team was able to suggest whether the T\&D analysis is a necessity for a particular study. The developed techniques, which are documented in detail through publications, are important additions to the literature in power system co-simulation.

  abstract = {The rapid expansion of consumer distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar photovoltaic generation in low-voltage distribution grids in Australia presents new challenges to network operation, such as voltage imbalances and over-voltage issues. To manage large numbers of DERs Distributed Network Service Providers (DNSPs) are adopting dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs), which specify a time-varying permissible capacity range for DER operation within the network operational constraints. However, the computation of these DOEs is complex and existing algorithms for calculating DOEs require high levels of network visibility that can be expensive to acquire at the large-scales of typical distribution grids. To overcome these difficulties, this paper investigates in comparative numerical simulation studies a power flow based decentralised algorithm that adapts the additive increase multiplicative decrease (AIMD) congestion control algorithm used in transmission control protocols to calculate DOEs distinctly for each partition of the network. The proposed algorithm presents several appealing features, including guaranteed voltage violation avoidance, fast calculation of localised DOEs, practical scalability for large networks, and increased total power export to the network.},

  abstract = {The present work was produced concurrently with the extension project entitled "System for Detecting Non-Technical Losses in Irrigation Areas Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques" and aims to determine non-technical losses of electrical energy in distribution systems using the energy balance methodology. Energy losses are quantified by type, which can be technical or non-technical (commercial) losses, and both together represent the overall losses of the system. Overall losses can be calculated based on the difference between the energy supplied by the utility company and the energy demanded by consumer units (UCs). Technical losses are inherent in the processes of generation, transmission, and energy conversion throughout the system, with Joule's Effect being one of the most well-known examples. On the other hand, non-technical losses refer to energy that was consumed but not billed by the supplying company. Therefore, to estimate the value of non-technical losses in the distribution system, based on the energy balance, real consumption and supply data, as well as information on the electrical networks provided by the CPFL Energia Group, were used. The Python language was used to automate a tool capable of performing the energy balance using the input data provided by the utility company. The employed methodology provides as output data the overall, technical, and non-technical losses of the analyzed distribution systems and identifies feeders with possible irregular consumer units. Once regions or feeders prone to non-conformities are identified, it facilitates the energy company in taking actions to minimize non-technical losses in the distribution electrical networks.},

  abstract = {Electrification and the growth of distributed energy resources (DERs), including flexible loads, are changing the energy landscape of electric distribution systems and creating new challenges and opportunities for electric utilities. Changes in demand profiles require improvements in distribution system load models, which have not historically accounted for device controllability or impacts on customer comfort. Although building modeling research has focused on these features, there is a need to incorporate them into distribution load models that include DERs and can be used to study grid-interactive buildings. In this paper, we present the Object-oriented, Controllable, High-resolution Residential Energy (OCHRE) model. OCHRE is a controllable thermal-electric residential energy model that captures building thermal dynamics, integrates grid-dependent electrical behavior, contains models for common DERs and end-use loads, and simulates at a time resolution down to 1~minute. It includes models for space heaters, air conditioners, water heaters, electric vehicles, photovoltaics, and batteries that are externally controllable and integrated in a co-simulation framework. Using a proposed zero energy ready community in Colorado, we co-simulate a distribution grid and 498 all-electric homes with a diverse set of efficiency levels and equipment properties. We show that controllable devices can reduce peak demand within a neighborhood by up to 73\% during a critical peak period without sacrificing occupant comfort. We also demonstrate the importance of modeling load diversity at a high time resolution when quantifying power and voltage fluctuations across a distribution system.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, the installed capacity of rooftop photovoltaic systems (PVs) has been increasing rapidly, faster than the traditional load increase rate. Differently from the loads, the simultaneity factor of rooftop PV generation is roughly 1.0, resulting in higher violations of technical and regulatory limits. One of the most widely adopted solutions to accommodate rooftop PVs is to perform grid reinforcements, such as reconductoring and circuit sectionalization. In several countries, the investments in grid reinforcement are transferred to the customers as energy tariff, impacting the economy. Because of that, the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL) is dedicating efforts to estimating the benefits and costs of integrating distributed generators into the power systems. In this context, this paper presents a Monte Carlo-based methodology that obtains the marginal costs of grid reinforcement for a Brazilian distribution utility, i.e., how much the installation of 1 kWp of rooftop PV costs. It is shown that the order the PVs are installed strongly affects the marginal cost and that a small part of the circuits is responsible for most reinforcement costs. Utilities and regulatory agencies can adopt this method to perform similar estimations.},

Adapting those problems so as to make them solvable with convex optimization techniques is an area of much academic and operational interest. In this paper, we present a method for solving OPF as a quadratic program by iteratively refining and re-initializing a linearized model of power flow based on the outputs of an associated nonlinear solver. The linear model on which we demonstrate this method is an adapted version of an approximation designed for use with unbalanced distribution networks. As an important benefit, the model allows for the explicit inclusion of nodal voltage phasor values in both the OPF problem's objective and its constraints, which opens the door to the idea of phasor-based control (PBC) design. We show in simulations on the IEEE 13-node test feeder that our method quickly converges to a set of phasor targets that are sufficiently precise for use in operations at the distribution level.},

  abstract = {The advancement of sensing technologies for the power grid has allowed the development of new strategies for the control of distributed energy resources (DERs). In particular, the emergence of phasor measurement units (PMUs) designed for deployment at the distribution level has presented an exciting opportunity. These PMUs have enabled the development of phasor-based control (PBC), a strategy that formulates DER power dispatch in terms of voltage phasor targets to be tracked by local controllers. This dissertation focuses on the optimal power flow (OPF) component of PBC’s supervisory control layer, which has previously been conceptualized and demonstrated in simulation on distribution networks. We expand its applicability to medium-voltage minigrids and micro- grids operating in island mode, networks where PBC has the potential to deliver important benefits. The work is carried out in two stages. After a discussion of PBC and other relevant back- ground topics, we address one of the primary challenges to PBC at the medium voltage level: the need for extreme accuracy in the supervisory controller’s generation of phasor targets. This accuracy is achieved through an adaptation of an iterative OPF methodology that re- fines a linearized model of power flow through successive exchanges with a nonlinear solver. We discuss the changes that were made to both linear model and nonlinear solver, as well as the determination of phasor targets on networks that include tap-changing transformers and other realistic equipment. The accuracy of the adapted iterative method is then shown in simulation. The second stage of the work covers the extension of our OPF implementation to islanded systems. We present a strategy for the treatment of the slack bus used by our nonlinear solver and apply it to several test cases in simulation. We then analyze a specific case in 2 which our iterative solution method fails, and demonstrate the use of a penalty factor in our linearized OPF formulation as a means of overcoming that failure. A full, end-to-end implementation of PBC’s supervisory layer is then proposed and tested on a number of DER distributions at different feeder penetration levels. We end with a presentation of data relevant to instrument-transformer-induced error in PMU measurements. This final portion stands alone from the primary work of the dissertation, but remains highly relevant to PBC. From an experimental deployment of two PMUs measuring an identical distribution-grid voltage, we determine a ratio of the errors induced by their individual potential transformers. Monitoring this quantity over the course of a year allows us to track the drift in those induced errors over time, motivating a discussion of the expected impact of error drift on PBC and the frequency with which transformers will need to be recalibrated in operational settings.},

  abstract = {The growth of distributed generation and the need of increasing Distribution Network (DN) resilience is encouraging Distribution System Operators (DSO) to increase awareness about the real-time status of the network as well as to actively manage flexible energy resources for improving system performances. In this context, Digital Twin (DT) is an enabling technology for a low-cost distributed framework that supports DN management. DT in the power system can be exploited taking advantage of the successful experiences in other sectors (e.g., smart manufacturing and building automation). This article presents a real case study of a DT development and its integration with an existing DN. The DT system architecture is based on the recent standards whilst main DT components have been originally developed, enabling near real-time services such as data collection, state estimation, and flexibility calculator. The individual performances of the integrated tools and the reliability of DT were tested and validated during one month of continuous operation. During the operation, good service continuity and accuracy performances were reported. Results from the flexibility calculator show the effectiveness of the proposed strategies that can improve the energy efficiency of the DN by increasing local self-consumption of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) production.},

  abstract = {Power quality (PQ) issues are direct consequences of integrating power electronics components and non-linear loads into microgrids. These issues can also be triggered by an unbalanced loading in the microgrid. Certainly, they affect the daily operation scheduling of the microgrid. This paper proposes an optimal harmonic power flow (OHPF) framework for the daily optimal scheduling of a grid-connected microgrid, which is constructed by combining the optimization formulation and harmonic power flow (HPF). Within the framework, PQ is evaluated by observing three indices including voltage magnitude, voltage total harmonic distortion (THDV), and voltage unbalance factor (VUF). A non-iterative mitigation scheme based on demand side management (DSM) is proposed to avoid PQ indices violations and is integrated into the optimization formulation part of the OHPF as a set of load constraints. The proposed constraints allow a flexible combination of different DSM actions including load shedding and interphase load transfer (ILT). Furthermore, the constraints to limit voltage magnitude, voltage THD, and VUF are integrated into the formulation in the form of penalty functions. The software implementation of the proposed OHPF involves Julia-based JuMP.jl and Gurobi solver for optimization part and OpenDSS for harmonic load flow part. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is tested using a modified IEEE 37-bus feeder for different load fluctuations, which allow different combinations of PQ indices violations. The assessment involves both normal and intentional islanding conditions. The results demonstrate that, under different random events, the proposed framework can avoid the violation of PQ indices limits in most cases without adding an excessive computational burden to the original optimization and harmonic load flow algorithms.},

The proposed approach is based on the design of a transmission-aware distribution planning model embedding DER growth uncertainty, which is used to determine a “menu” of secure distribution network upgrade options with different associated costs and peak netload guarantees observed from the transmission-side, referred here as Netload Range Cost Curves (NRCCs). NRCCs can provide a practical approach for coordinating T\&D planning exercises, as these curves can be integrated into existing transmission planning workflows, and specify a direct incentive for distribution planners to evaluate peak netload reduction alternatives in their planning process. We perform computational experiments based on a realistic distribution network that demonstrate the benefits and applicability of our proposed planning approach.},

On the other hand, utilities are also installing medium-size BESSs on LV systems to assist in system operation. This massive integration of medium and small-sized BESS into PV-rich LV systems can create adverse impacts on the circuit operation as each BESS can operate with a different control mode, with different control settings. Therefore, since there are distinct control modes of operation, it is necessary to analyze them and how their parametrization and combined operation affect the grid indices. The parametrization and impacts of multiple BESS operating in an LV system are investigated in this paper through quasi-static time series simulations on a real LV gated community network with high PV penetration. The results reveal the need for properly coordinating the operation of the multiple BESS, otherwise, operating indices of the grid may deteriorate significantly.},

The method aggregates problem data in a graph, where the feeder topology is represented by the graph links and nodes attributes can encapsulate any selected information such as operated devices, electrical characteristics and measurements at the point. The main advantage of the proposed solution is that it is immune to network reconfiguration and allows the use of a single trained model on multiple feeders. An experiment was conducted with faults simulated on 10 different feeders, all of them based on actual distribution feeders. The results shows that the model is able to generalize the correlations learned on training to correctly predict the fault region in most cases, even on a feeder it has not seen before.},

A simple link failure or a sophisticated cyberattack launched against the grid's monitoring, communication, and control infrastructure could rapidly grow out of control, making the grid unstable. We investigate the design and implementation of a high-fidelity smart grid simulation platform which integrates a network simulator and a power flow simulator using the Mosaik co-simulation framework. The platform allows for evaluating the performance of new control algorithms and understanding dynamics of modern distribution grids. Example case studies are presented to validate the proposed platform.},

By its attractive features such as fast response and decreasing price, the ESS can be used in various scenarios in the electrical system. Among them, we highlight the profit from the purchase and sale of electricity and the improvement of the voltage profile. The objective of this work is to evaluate the operation of the storage system by using the Multi-objective Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization (MEPSO) to perform energy arbitrage and jointly improve the voltage profile of the network. The MEPSO is used to find a set of operational decisions to buy or store energy using the prices of the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) and, within these decisions, to operate the ESS during the Real-Time Market (RTM) hours. The results are promising and evidence that, through the proposed methodology, it is possible to perform energy arbitrage with the improvement of the voltage profile and a low number of charging/discharging cycles.},

  abstract = {A modeling framework integrating both building energy modeling and power system modeling is introduced for the design of net zero energy (NZE) districts for the simultaneous selection of both demand-side efficiency measures and supply-side generation technologies. A novel district control scheme is proposed for pursuing NZE on a subhourly basis while mitigating potential grid impacts such as power backfeeding and voltage violations. As a case study, Peña Station NEXT, a new 100-building, mixed-use district on a 1200-node distribution feeder in Denver, Colorado, is modeled in the integrated framework. An exhaustive scenario analysis is conducted for sizing the district's distributed energy resources, considering multiple objectives such as capital cost, net energy import, and equipment violations. When trying to achieve annual NZE, the district incurs frequent operating violations, and achieving NZE on a 15-min basis is also limited by seasonal fluctuations in photovoltaic output, illustrating the need for diverse generation or seasonal storage. As a practical compromise, both annual and 15-min district import can be reduced by ∼78\% without significant violations.},

To better analyze the impacts of DERs on both transmission and distribution systems, a comprehensive T\&D co-simulation platform is developed. Further, with DERs more actively participating in system operation-e.g., by providing real-time grid services-their cyber vulnerability needs to be better understood to maintain system reliability. This paper discusses a cyber-physical events emulation-based T\&D co-simulation platform to perform comprehensive cyber events emulations, physical simulation, and analysis of interdependent impacts. Results from the case studies-which show how cyber events on a synthetic distribution network can impact operations on the transmission and distribution network-validate that the proposed T\&D cosimulation platform can perform cyber-physical events emulation and produce response in near realtime; therefore, with extensive simulation using the proposed co-simulation platform, the system operators can accumulate adequate training data for system situational awareness of grid anomalies.},

Consumers and prosumers (those who have energy generation resources), however, do not have expertise to engage in repeated P2P trading, and the zero-marginal costs of renewables present challenges in determining fair market prices. To address these issues, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to help automate consumers' bidding and management of their solar PV and energy storage resources, under a specific P2P clearing mechanism that utilizes the so-called supply-demand ratio. In addition, we show how the MARL framework can integrate physical network constraints to realize decentralized voltage control, hence ensuring physical feasibility of the P2P energy trading and paving ways for real-world implementations.},

In particular, Distribution System Operators (DSOs) show special concern regarding faults that could potentially prove hazardous towards citizens. In particular, High Voltage (HV) Line Down faults occur when an overhead line on the HV network falls to the ground, losing supply from the HV side but remaining live from the Low Voltage (LV) side. These faults are extremely hazardous and life-threatening to both people and wildlife. Moreover, this kind of event destabilises the voltages on the LV side, which fall to levels far below their rating and that may be too low to ensure quality of supply to customers. This paper presents the Eneida DeepGrid® HV Line Down fault detection method and its performance under various scenarios. Results show that this method is able to correctly detect and pinpoint faults, as well as identify the faulty phase.},

Employing an evolutionary game framework, the study scrutinizes the strategic evolution of DERs’ decision-making processes in their interactions with the MGO. Modeled as an evolutionary game, these interactions encapsulate the strategies adopted by DERs, resulting in stable equilibrium strategies over time. Motivated by direct benefits linked to increased active power production, DERs strive to sell all available power, while the MGO focuses on optimizing the microgrid’s overall performance. The study assesses the microgrid’s performance in terms of its power factor, emphasizing the strategic balance DERs must achieve in their active power generation to avoid penalization. This penalization results in decreased individual utility for DERs due to the overall power factor decrease resulting from their prioritization of active power generation. Additionally, the diminished overall power factor implies a decrease in MGO utility. The individual utility of each DER is further influenced by the strategies adopted by other DERs, impacting the penalization factor. Leveraging a modified IEEE 13-node distribution microgrid consisting of three DERs, the study presents case studies encompassing both cooperative and non-cooperative evolutionary game scenarios. These case studies illuminate the intricacies of interactions and the resulting equilibrium outcomes.},

By comparing our method against such myopic techniques on real distribution systems, we show that our algorithm is able to reduce the overall integration costs by looking at future decisions. Because hosting capacity is hard to compute, this problem requires efficient methods to search the space. We demonstrate that heuristics using domain-specific knowledge can be efficiently used to improve the algorithm performance, such that real distribution systems can be studied.},

The objective of both is to investigate functionalities available in most photovoltaic (PV) inverters to modulate active and reactive power autonomously based on local voltage measurements for the purpose of mitigating off-nominal grid voltage conditions. Specifically of interest are volt/volt-ampere reactive (VAR) control and volt/watt control, the effect of those functions on quasi-steady-state feeder voltages, and the impact of the functions on PV energy production. Because volt/VAR and volt/watt control autonomously adjust inverter output based on local conditions without requiring communication with any other devices, they are good candidates to increase PV hosting capacity when it is limited by voltage constraints in a feeder with very large numbers of PV systems.},

It leverages the existing blockchain attributes to provide clear value propositions that are applicable to transactive energy market applications. Those attributes are evaluated to not only facilitate the energy market mechanisms but also assist with the cybersecurity requirements, such as access control management (including identification, authentication, and authorization); data security and integrity; and resilience management (decentralization, scalability, and performance during faults). The validity of the proposed framework is demonstrated using a real-time, five-minute double-auction market. The results highlight the framework benefits and provide a strong validation of its applicability to blockchain-based transactive energy systems.

  abstract = {Unbalanced three-phase low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs) modeling, optimization, and control are essential for enabling high photovoltaic (PV) penetration levels. Accordingly, a new case study is developed to show the gaps and challenges at different PV penetration levels in LVDNs. In this case study, the aim is to provide a better understanding of LVDNs’ behavior in order to support the development and validation of the models and tools. Therefore, a reduction model is proposed to decrease the simulation time by lowering the number of buses in the IEEE European LV Test Feeder, with a negligible error. In addition, an OpenDSS-Julia interface is developed to demonstrate the effects of different PV penetration levels on the inverters’ behavior, active power curtailment, and voltage level in LVDNs. Results are demonstrated concerning several limitations and challenges in using existing smart inverter control techniques, in terms of the inverters’ behavior, active power curtailment, and the voltage level. These limitations and challenges include over-voltage issues using the constant power factor technique, high active power curtailment using the volt–watt technique, and high current flows in the network assets and poor power factors using the volt–var technique. In addition, state-of-the-art system models have not taken-into-account the modeling of uncertainty effects on the performance of PV modules. Similarly, such models have largely ignored the internal and standby losses in the inverter models. These neglected issues may lead to under- or over-estimation of the impacts of PV systems on LVDNs and inaccurate estimations of the network’s ability to accommodate high PV penetration levels.},

However, communication channels used by DERMS controllers, along with the unmanned substations where they are deployed, provide a target for cyber attackers to cause severe voltage disturbances. The voltage problems can damage equipment, trip inverters, and cause undesirable operations of voltage regulating devices. In this paper, using detailed cyber-physical models, the various cyberattack paths an adversary may use to conduct falsified control command cyberattacks are presented. Robust and fast acting centralized cyber layer and de-centralized inverter intrusion detection are also proposed. This two-tiered system can detect and mitigate these cyberattacks before the power system layer is impacted, even if the DERMS controller itself has been compromised. The cyberattack models and proposed intrusion detection techniques have been validated using IEEE test feeders.},

  abstract = {Distributed photovoltaic systems can cause adverse distribution system impacts, including voltage violations at customer locations and thermal overload of lines, transformers, and other equipment resulting from high current. The installed capacity at which violations first occur and above which would require system upgrades is called the hosting capacity. Current static methods for determining hosting capacity tend to either consider infrequent worst-case snapshots in time and/or capture coarse time and spatial resolution. Because the duration of violations cannot be captured with these traditional methods, the metric thresholds used in these studies conservatively use the strictest constraints given in operating standards, even though both worse voltage performance and higher overloads may be temporarily acceptable. However, assessing the full details requires accurately capturing time-dependence, voltage-regulating equipment operations, and performance of advanced controls-based mitigation techniques. In this paper, we propose a dynamic distributed photovoltaic hosting capacity methodology to address these issues by conducting power flow analysis for a full year. A key contribution is the formulation of time aware metrics to take these annual results and identify the hosting capacity. Through a case study, we show that this approach can more fully capture grid impacts of distributed photovoltaic than traditional methods and the dynamic hosting capacity was 60\%–200\% higher than the static hosting capacity in this case study.},

  abstract = {An increase in Electric Vehicles (EV) will result in higher demands on the distribution electric power systems (EPS) which may result in thermal line overloading and low voltage violations. To understand the impact, this work simulates two EV charging scenarios (home- and work-dominant) under potential 2030 EV adoption levels on 10 actual distribution feeders that support residential, commercial, and industrial loads. The simulations include actual driving patterns of existing (non-EV) vehicles taken from global positioning system (GPS) data. The GPS driving behaviors, which explain the spatial and temporal EV charging demands, provide information on each vehicles travel distance, dwell locations, and dwell durations. Then, the EPS simulations incorporate the EV charging demands to calculate the power flow across the feeder. Simulation results show that voltage impacts are modest (less than 0.01 p.u.), likely due to robust feeder designs and the models only represent the high-voltage (“primary”) system components. Line loading impacts are more noticeable, with a maximum increase of about 15\%. Additionally, the feeder peak load times experience a slight shift for residential and mixed feeders (≈1 h), not at all for the industrial, and 8 h for the commercial feeder.},

  abstract = {Distribution network reconfiguration, as a part of the distribution management system, plays an important role in increasing the energy efficiency of the distribution network by coordinating the operations of the switches in the distribution network. Dynamic distribution network reconfiguration (DDNR), enabled by the sufficient number of remote switching devices in the distribution network, attempts to find the optimal topologies of the distribution network over the specified time interval. This paper proposes data-driven DDNR based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). DRL-based DDNR controller aims to minimize the objective function, i.e. active energy losses and the cost of switching manipulations while satisfying the constraints. The following constraints are considered: allowed bus voltages, allowed line apparent powers, a radial network configuration with all buses being supplied, and the maximal allowed number of switching operations. This optimization problem is modelled as a Markov decision process by defining the possible states and actions of the DDNR agent (controller) and rewards that lead the agent to minimize the objective function while satisfying the constraints. Switching operation constraints are modelled by modifying the action space definition instead of including the additional penalty term in the reward function, to increase the computational efficiency. The proposed algorithm was tested on three test examples: small benchmark network, real-life large-scale test system and IEEE 33-bus radial system, and the results confirmed the robustness and scalability of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {With the increasing amount of distributed energy resources (DERs) integration, there is a significant need to model and analyze hosting capacity (HC) for future electric distribution grids. Hosting capacity analysis (HCA) examines the amount of DERs that can be safely integrated into the grid and is a challenging task in full generality because there are many possible integration of DERs in foresight. That is, there are numerous extreme points between feasible and infeasible sets. Moreover, HC depends on multiple factors such as (a) adoption patterns of DERs that depend on socio-economic behaviors and (b) how DERs are controlled and managed. These two factors are intrinsic to the problem space because not all integration of DERs may be centrally planned, and could largely change our understanding about HC. This paper addresses the research gap by capturing the two factors (a) and (b) in HCA and by identifying a few most insightful HC scenarios at the cost of domain knowledge. We propose a data-driven HCA framework and introduce active learning in HCA to effectively explore scenarios. Active learning in HCA and characteristics of HC with respect to the two factors (a) and (b) are illustrated in a 3-bus example. Next, detailed largescale studies are proposed to understand the significance of (a) and (b). Our findings suggest that HC and its interpretations significantly change subject to the two factors (a) and (b).},

  abstract = {Electric power systems are undergoing a transformation, characterized by an increase in power electronic converter interfaced technologies, e.g. wind and solar resources, FACTS devices, High-Voltage DC (HVDC) lines or power electronic interfaced loads. Increasing penetration of renewable energy resources, low gas prices, and the retirement of coal and nuclear power plants motivate the use of gas-fired power plants to mitigate the variability and uncertainty of wind and solar resources. The reliance on natural gas for electricity generation has increased over the past years in the US which comes with associated reliability and security risks due to the dependency an energy system may have on one another. Poor coordination between power and gas operations may compound the weaknesses of an already congested network. In addition, the proliferation of smart grid technologies that control distribution systems introduce higher levels of variability and uncertainty to the operation of power grids. In this research, we present a set of tools to model energy systems, including transmission and distribution power systems, or natural gas pipelines, and cyber networks. This framework is then used to devise algorithms that improve the security and reliability of interdependent energy systems and propose counter-measures against unexpected events.The first part of this thesis (Chapter 2) presents the models and algorithms to simulate and optimize North American power and gas delivery operations, both in transmission and distribution systems. The second part of this thesis (Chapter 3) provides novel datasets that aim to serve as a support to perform studies using the models proposed in Chapter 2. In this section, we focus our efforts in natural gas datasets in the continental United States, filling a gap in the literature and enabling academic studies of coupled natural gas and electricity delivery operations. In addition, we propose models to generate high-resolution and scalable solar time series to better capture the impacts of renewable energy uncertainty and variability on power system operations. The last part of this thesis (Chapters 4 and 5) studies the events that compromise security and reliability of energy systems from two different angles. We consider contingency events that are a result of a cyber-attack, e.g. perpetuated by a terrorist group or a nation-state, or due to natural circumstances, e.g. failure of a generator unit and extreme weather events. In these chapters, we propose algorithms and counter-measures to mitigate contingency events by ensuring that the system can operate in a safe and flexible secure region.},

  abstract = {As the penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into distribution systems increases, so does the interest in forecasting relevant system variables to help mitigate the associated challenges. One such challenge is the more frequent occurrence of excessive voltages in distribution systems with higher shares of DERs. Accurate and reliable estimates together with forecasts of system states (i.e., nodal voltages) will therefore play a key role in improving the utilization of these variable and uncertain sources while mitigating potential operational risks. Whilst recent literature has explored machine learning (ML) methods for voltage estimation and their extrapolation for a short-time period into the future, few have taken uncertainty quantification into account, and these methods have not yet been translated into operations. This paper discusses the advantages offered by probabilistic voltage forecasts and proposes a non-parametric Bayesian method suitable for forecasting nodal voltages at short-term time horizons while accounting for uncertainties in load and distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation. We demonstrate the value of the proposed Gaussian process (GP) model for a case study using historical forecasts and observation data.},

Specifically, the report details the methodology and results of an analysis that: 1. Identifies potential grid violations that would be induced by a PV system requesting interconnection to a distribution circuit; 2. Identifies multiple technically viable options for mitigating the potential violations, including infrastructure upgrades, downsizing the PV system size, curtailment of PV, and addition of battery energy storage; 3. Defines the required technical operating parameters of the system in order to mitigate all potential violations (the "Operating Envelope"); 4. Compares the economics of each option, from the PV developer's perspective. The analysis supports the ongoing evolution of interconnection standards for combined PV and energy storage systems by providing a methodology to define allowable maximum export limits during each hour. The methodology presented could be used by utilities as part of the interconnection study process, to inform negotiations with DER developers and the drafting of mutually acceptable interconnection agreements. The resulting technical operating parameters could be included as part of the interconnection service agreement (ISA) between the system owner and the utility company. The companion report to this analysis, Gill et al. (2022), details the envisioned framework for the implementation of the technical operating parameters.},

  abstract = {Emerging distributed energy resources (DERs)—such as solar photovoltaics (PV), battery energy storage systems (BESS), and electric vehicles (EVs)—are expected to increase substantially in India in the coming years following policy-driven targets of the Government of India to modernize its electricity system, reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), and improve air quality. These emerging technologies can pose challenges to distribution utilities, forcing overhauls in planning and operational practices. They can also create challenges in power system infrastructure planning and cause more frequent system operational violations (e.g., network voltage bounds and loading thresholds) if not properly integrated. The impacts on the localized power distribution grid from these emerging technologies manifest in increased infrastructure investments and erratic shifts in demand patterns. These impacts are not yet well understood, and analytic solutions are not readily available. To address these challenges, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), in collaboration with BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd. (BRPL), developed an advanced power distribution system impact analysis framework of BRPL’s distribution system. This framework helps analyze the readiness of the power distribution network to accommodate emerging technologies and the potential opportunities they might introduce. The framework has been predominantly set up to evaluate distributed PV, BESS, and EVs. In this collaboration between NREL and BRPL, we developed and evaluated the framework on two distribution feeders in the BRPL territory for various scenarios of BESS and EVs. BESS are evaluated for their effectiveness on the grid to mitigate present and future feeder overloading scenarios, and they are subsequently analyzed for their costs compared to the costs of traditional upgradation measures. Scenarios include assessing the effects of EV density on grid infrastructure upgrades and interlinking EV management with BESS integration.},

Since both the transportation network and the power grid already experience periods of significant stress, joint analyses of both infrastructures will most likely be necessary to ensure acceptable operation in the future. To enable such analyses, this article presents an open-source testbed that jointly simulates high-fidelity models of both the electric distribution system and the transportation network. The testbed utilizes two open-source simulators, OpenDSS to simulate the electric distribution system and the microscopic traffic simulator SUMO to simulate the traffic dynamics. Electric vehicle charging links the electric distribution system and the transportation network models at vehicle locations determined using publicly available parcel data. Leveraging high-fidelity synthetic electric distribution system data from the SMART-DS project and transportation system data from OpenStreetMap, this testbed models the city of Greensboro, NC down to the household level. Moreover, the methodology and the supporting scripts released with the testbed allow adaption to other areas where high-fidelity geolocated OpenDSS datasets are available.

This article presents an evaluation of the costs to utilities due to technical losses and compensations paid to consumers given the violation of voltage limits in steady-state conditions for LVDNs subjected to the joint connection of DGPV and EV with Volt-Var control. In this study, the networks are defined, along with the curves of EV chargers and PVDG, and residences with the joint connection of DGPV and EV. The simulations are based on a gradual increase in the combined penetration level in steps of 20\%. The results obtained for two real networks demonstrate the high costs of compensation compared to technical losses and the effectiveness of local Volt-Var control in reducing overall operational costs for the utility.},

  abstract = {Most recently, stochastic control methods such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have proven to be efficient and quick converging methods in providing localized grid voltage control. Because of the random dynamical characteristics of grid reactive loads and bus voltages, such stochastic control methods are particularly useful in accurately predicting future voltage levels and in minimizing associated cost functions. Although DRL is capable of quickly inferring future voltage levels given specific voltage control actions, it is prone to high variance when the learning rate or discount factors are set for rapid convergence in the presence of bus noise. Evolutionary learning is also capable of minimizing cost function and can be leveraged for localized grid control, but it does not infer future voltage levels given specific control inputs and instead simply selects those control actions that result in the best voltage control. For this reason, evolutionary learning is better suited than DRL for voltage control in noisy grid environments. To illustrate this, using a cyber adversary to inject random noise, we compare the use of evolutionary learning and DRL in autonomous voltage control (AVC) under noisy control conditions and show that it is possible to achieve a high mean voltage control using a genetic algorithm (GA). We show that the GA additionally can provide superior AVC to DRL with comparable computational efficiency. We illustrate that the superior noise immunity properties of evolutionary learning make it a good choice for implementing AVC in noisy environments or in the presence of random cyber-attacks.},

The current co-simulation is applied to Oakland and Alameda, California, and in future work will be extended to the full San Francisco Bay Area. It uses the HELICS co-simulation framework to enable parallel instances of vetted grid and transportation software programs to interact at every model timestep, allowing high-fidelity simulations at a large scale. This enables not only the impacts of electrified transportation systems across a larger interconnected collection of distribution feeders to be evaluated, but also the feedbacks between the two systems, such as through control systems, to be captured and compared. The findings are that with moderate passenger EV adoption rates, inverter controls combined with some distribution system hardware upgrades can maintain grid voltages within ANSI C.84 range A limits of 0.95 to 1.05 p.u. without smart charging. However, EV charging control may be required for higher levels of charging or to reduce grid upgrades, and this will be explored in future work.},

To tackle this issue, this work proposes to use the smart inverters from photovoltaic systems to compensate, in real-time, the exact amount of reactive power demanded by the customers to which they are connected. The proposed strategy does not require expensive and complex communication infrastructure, active power curtailment, or inverters over­ sizing. With a simple infrastructure, it decreases energy losses and the need for capacitor banks. Time-series power-flow simulations are performed in a real distribution system. The results indicate that the proposed strategy of var compensation mitigates more energy losses and voltage transgression than for the cases in which the smart inverters operate with unity power factor, Volt-Watt, or Volt-var control rules.},

To address this, the author presents a deep learning-based approach for line parameter and topology estimation using historical measurements from μPMUs under partial observability. The proposed method incorporates a deep neural network (DNN) with a learnable regularizer, which takes into account the underlying system topology to achieve accurate and reliable line parameter and topology estimation. The proposed algorithm addresses the nonlinearity of power flows by unrolling the Gauss-Newton solver. This iterative process involves minimizing the losses and the learning regularization term alternatively.

Porém, isso pode prejudicar o desempenho do sistema de proteção, e por isso, deve-se adaptar às alterações causadas pela reconfiguração. Desta forma, o presente trabalho propõe uma metodologia de proteção adaptativa para determinar os grupos de ajustes dos relés de sobrecorrente para cada topologia e com a possibilidade de modificar seus ajustes de acordo com as variações da rede durante a operação da rede. Para isso, as topologias radiais são obtidas através da operação de abertura e fechamento de chaves.

Os valores do Time Multiplier Setting (TMS) e da Pickup Current (PC) dos relés de sobrecorrente são calculados usando o algoritmo de Otimização pelo Enxame de Partículas Evolucionária Diferencial (do inglês DEPSO) modificado neste trabalho. Como resultado, é possível reduzir o número de ajustes necessários para manter a seletividade e a coordenação do sistema de proteção.

  abstract = {With more and more applications of distributed energy resources powered by renewable energy in distribution power systems, there is an increasing need to improve power system’s resiliency for reliable and continuous power supply and efficiency while reducing carbon emissions. To reach this target, we investigate the path to study distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution systems from planning, real-time operation and control, restoration and reconfiguration after faults. First, we introduce metrics of microgrid performance and use these metrics in DERs planning and storage analysis with testing of battery model to evaluate transient stability and mode transition. The metrics are used in the following chapters to evaluate power loss, voltage deviation in Volt-VAR control, and operational complexity in restoration. The combination of distribution system and DERs modeling are used to validate clustering method for size and site solutions for distributed generation using time series simulation. Furthermore, sizing and siting of DERs in a distribution system has been studied to intentionally form multiple self-sufficient microgrids to increase resiliency. However, DER planning is not adequate for real-time operations and avoiding voltage violations caused by intermittent power generation from photovoltaic sources. Thus, our second contribution is a localized model-free Volt-VAR optimization (VVO) approach for network power loss minimization. The proposed controller is a combination of the extremum seeking algorithm to achieve the network-level objective without communications with other decision-making agents and an adaptive droop controller to achieve a stable response under fast varying phenomena. We also evaluate the theoretical conditions for localized results to approach to centralized optimal solutions. Finally, we implement deep Q learning (DQN) in load restoration using switch operations for random fault scenarios. To evaluate the capability of the DQN model, we build OpenAI gym compatible environment integrating OpenDSS, tune learning rate and hidden layers configuration of neural network, and make predictions using trained model. These results show that the DQN provides decisions perform close to human experience results with only partial measurements and status of the system. These three contributions include DERs planning, volt-VAR optimization and control, and load restoration in distribution power systems.},

Among the potential applications, the mitigation of non-technical losses is an important benefit for the utilities and the customers. High levels of unknown consumption deteriorate the system operation and increase its costs. Usually, part of the non-technical losses costs is assigned to the customers, and part to the utilities, representing revenue loss and high-energy tariffs. In this scenario, this work investigates the application of smart meters measurements to detect and locate non-technical losses in low voltage systems. The proposed methodology is based on the coefficient of determination evaluation obtained from a multiple linear regression model of the circuit.

  abstract = {The increase of distributed generators and energy storage devices in modern distribution systems impacts the demand provided by the distribution utility and, hence, the techniques employed to determine the Transmission System Usage Amount at the border with the transmission system. If the contracted demand is violated, the utility must pay inefficiency charges. The complexity of this new reality is the stochastic characteristics associated with the new devices installed at medium and low voltage levels. In this context, this work proposes a methodology composed of a linear programming model to determine the demand to be contracted by the distribution utility. This work incorporates the problem uncertainties by integrating historical data and demand forecasting from the distribution utility and the Brazilian Energy Research Company. The developed methodology obtained a 1.5\% error compared to the contracted demand which would lead to the minimum annual demand cost when applied to a Brazilian system.},

  abstract = {Recently, numerous data-driven approaches to control an electric grid using machine learning techniques have been investigated. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based techniques provide a credible alternative to conventional, optimization-based solvers especially when there is uncertainty in the environment, such as renewable generation or cyber system performance. Efficiently training an agent, however, requires numerous interactions with an environment to learn the best policies. There are numerous RL environments for power systems, and, similarly, there are environments for communication systems. Most cyber system simulators are based in a UNIX environment, while the power system simulators are based in the Windows operating system. Hence the generation of a cyber-physical, mixed-domain RL environment has been challenging. Existing co-simulation methods are efficient, but are resource and time intensive to generate large-scale data sets for training RL agents. Hence, this work focuses on the development and validation of a mixed-domain RL environment using OpenDSS for the power system and leveraging a discrete event simulator Python package, SimPy for the cyber system, which is operating system agnostic. Further, we present the results of co-simulation and training RL agents for a cyber-physical network reconfiguration and Volt-Var control problem in a power distribution feeder.},

  abstract = {The increase in the photovoltaic generation on distribution grids may create problems, such as voltage-violations. To gain situational awareness for system operation, e.g., adjusting the tap-settings of the transformers or adjust capacitor banks, utilities need situational awareness about locations and amounts of photovoltaic powers being generated in different feeders. Unfortunately, many utilities not only lack observability of the distribution grid, e.g., no secondary grid schematics but also have no situational awareness on which feeders solar panels locate. To understand where the solar users are roughly, we propose to use the feeder measurements from utilities with solar panel measurements from third-party solar companies. Due to the property of active correlation detection, we propose several sequentially improved methods based on quantitative association rule mining (QARM), where we also provide a lower bound for performance guarantees based on the amount of available data and the size of the bin for clustering. However, the binning of data leads to information loss. So, we design a band to replace bin for creating a new data mining approach for robustness. We validate our result for the IEEE 4-, 8-, 123-, 8500-bus cases with the Pecan-Street dataset, and also for the IEEE 123-bus case under low/high penetration and with radial/weakly meshed configurations. For realistic validation, we also obtain real data from a utility and a solar power company in the same zip codes in a city of California. Numerical results show accurate associations of feeders and solar panels, leading to increased situational awareness of the secondary distribution grids.},

The microgrid under study, ConGRID, is located in a condominium in Barão Geraldo, Campinas, Brazil, and consists of real consumers with PV generation installed on their houses and a BESS connected at the point of common coupling. The paper provides a methodology for simulating power smoothing at ConGRID using OpenDSS, an electric grid simulator, using Simple Moving Average (SMA). The simulations were carried out using Python programming language with the support of the Google Colab environment. Results show that using the BESS for smoothing the distributed PV generation using an aggregated profile increases the power and voltage oscillations in the point of common coupling. However, when the smoothing algorithm uses the power at the distribution transformer as the reference, the strategy benefits the power system, reducing power and voltage oscillations between ConGRID and the main grid.},

  abstract = {Distributed Energy Resources penetration levels continue to increase across distribution networks, producing a wide variety of challenges for system operators. Creating among others, the need for new or improved methods that can manage their output characteristics. This has led to regulatory amendments that are expected to facilitate secure grid operations while continuing to enable increasing levels of Distributed Energy Resources penetration. However, it is still unclear if these systems will behave as intended in the presence of a cyber attack.To address this fundamental question, this work presents a detailed cybersecurity analysis on Distributed Energy Resources and Internet of Things infrastructure, covering a wide variety of angles from assessing device-level vulnerabilities to proposing methods/metrics that can quantify risk at the system-level. In addition, this work introduces two, fully-virtualized cyber-physical testbeds that have been envisioned for cyber-security researchers. It is expected that these software-based tools can aid to develop better, more secure Internet of Things and Distributed Energy Resource-based deployments.Furthermore, methods for ensuring correct operation at the device-level and distribution system-level are presented. In specific, a Trusted Execution Environment solution, which relies on hardware-level process isolation has been developed to provide digital-attestation services on analog inputs. The final contribution of this work is the development of a distributed fail-safe method for managing Volt-Var operations. The proposed method combines local voltage information (from independent agents) and simplified network models to determine the expected voltage output before actually executing the command using consensus-voting techniques. The underlying distributed consensus methods and power models work together to ensure that a final decision not only satisfies traditional power system constraints such as security (correctness) and dependability but also availability and partition tolerance under distributed systems theory.},

The approach guarantees consistency among scenarios of the same deployment by ensuring that higher penetration scenarios contain PV units deployed in lower penetration scenarios. It also constrains the size and spatial distribution of the PV plants and considers three placement types. A case study on a real-world distribution system proves that the precepts of scenario consistency, deployment diversity, and placement are met. The study further investigates the impact of the resulting scenarios via a stochastic hosting capacity analysis. Results indicate that the ratio between PV and load sizes, referred to as the nodal PV penetration factor (NPPF), is a key driver of the grid integration impact. By reducing the NPPF from 5 to 2, the maximum hosting capacity increased by at least 112\%. The study also reveals that scenarios under random placement can lead to higher hosting capacity values.},

Internet of Things (IoT) makes it possible to develop an IoT platform that can help with the integration of a smart charging algorithm with the CPO.

In this paper, an algorithm for simulating the utilization and availability of public EV charging stations (CSs) has been developed. Based on several EV user features, the proposed algorithm generates realistic scenarios of CS availability, utilization, and impact over the distribution network via AC power flows. Moreover, the impact of considering smart charging (i.e., remote CS power limit control) and price policies is also modeled by the proposed algorithm. With these enhancements, the proposed simulation tool is used to predict the aggregated behavior of a population of EV users within the vicinity of two real distribution feeders.

  abstract = {There has been a significant growth in the distributed energy resources (DERs) connected to the distribution networks in recent years. For a distribution system with a high penetration of DERs, a detailed modeling and representation of the distribution network is needed to accurately assess its steady-state and dynamic behavior. In this dissertation, a field-validated model for a real sub-transmission and distribution network is developed, including one of the feeders modeled with the secondary network and loads and solar PV units at their household/user location. A procedure is developed combining data from various sources such as the utility database, geoinformation data, and field measurements to create an accurate network model. Applying a single line to ground fault to the detailed distribution feeder model, a high voltage swell, with potentially detrimental impacts on connected equipment, is shown in one of the non-faulted phases of the feeder. The reason for this voltage swell is analyzed in detail. It is found that with appropriate control the solar PV units on the feeder can reduce the severity of the voltage swell, but not entirely eliminate it. For integrated studies of the transmission-distribution (T\&D) network, a T\&D co-simulation framework is developed, which is capable of power flow as well as dynamic simulations, and supports unbalanced modeling and disturbances in the distribution as well as the sub-transmission system. The power flow co-simulation framework is developed as a module that can be run on a cloud-based platform. Using the developed framework, the T\&D system response is studied for balanced and unbalanced faults on the distribution and sub-transmission system. For some faults the resultant loss of generation can potentially lead to the entire feeder tripping due to high unbalance at the substation. However, it is found that advanced inverter controls may improve the response of the distribution feeders to the faults. The dissertation also highlights the importance of modeling the secondary network for both steady-state and dynamic studies. Lastly, a preliminary investigation is conducted to include different dynamic elements such as grid-forming inverters in a T\&D network simulation.},

  abstract = {The massive growth of photovoltaic (PV) generators connected to low voltage (LV) systems is making it impractical for utilities to conduct a detailed technical analysis to approve every connection request. In response, this paper proposes simple equations to quickly estimate the PV hosting capacity on any circuit location without the need to run power flow simulations. By representing all loads and generators as constant current consumption/injection, the superposition theorem can be used to calculate the impact of each new PV on voltage magnitude and current flows. This approach can be used on a first screening assessment to immediately filter out cases that present no risk of technical violations to the circuit. Only connection requests flagged with risk of violation in this initial screening must be analyzed in detail by specialized engineers. Any type of PV connection (single-phase, two-phase, three-phase) in unbalanced multiphase LV systems can be analyzed. Extensive validation studies reveal that this approach is conservative, which makes it safe and reliable for quick first screening analyses. Its estimation errors are between 5\% and 18\%. Recommendations on how to employ the proposed approach in practice are also presented.},

  abstract = {Due to the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources, congestion problems are already emerging in Dutch distribution grids. The available flexibility of assets in the built environment could have the potential to reduce congestion if prosumers are properly incentivized by distribution grid operators (DSOs). However, it is not yet clear what (combinations of) flexibility a ctivation mechanisms will be effective for congestion management in Dutch Distribution grids. To shed light on this issue, the GO-e consortium aims at performing large-scale agent-based simulations of up to 120 low-voltage networks and a large variety of possible instruments and scenarios. For this reason, we developed a novel scalable time-discrete simulation framework for distributed agent-based simulations of energy systems. We demonstrate the framework on a case-study in which we assess the effectiveness of a dynamic bandwidth tariff instrument on overloading problems in a low-voltage network containing solar panels, batteries, and heat pumps. It was shown that a dynamic bandwidth tariff can successfully resolve forecasted congestion if the associated costs are high enough compared to the day-ahead prices. However, the resulting load shifting can cause new congestion intra-day aswell.},

This study discusses an alternate approach for the combined T\&D systems analysis using co-simulation technique. The proposed framework couples the analysis of the two systems by iteratively exchanging the power flow variables at the PCC.

  abstract = {Over the past century, US electric grid has evolved into an extremely complex and large interconnected grid identified by the National Academy of Engineers (NAE) as the greatest engineering achievement of the century. During that period, the overwhelming accepted principle was “larger or bigger the better”. The AC transmission voltage went up to 765 kV and the individual generating units were in excess of 1,000 MW. This centralized generation model was considered to be efficient and reliable way to operate the grid. This grid continued to serve the nation well. It, however, faced serious challenges with the demands of the 21st century that will require high penetration of renewable energy, environmental impact of large power plants, global warming and climate change, carbon emission and global energy sustainability. New approach had to be taken to adopt the new regulatory policies. Emerging trends such as low-cost natural gas, increased deployment of renewable energy technologies in distribution, and continued evolution of electricity markets are transforming the ways to generate and deliver electricity. Other factors such as environmental policies to reduce the carbon footprint, maximize the energy efficiency by utilizing the distributed based renewable energy generation also influence the future grid structure. Aging infrastructure combined with the growth and the evolving de-centralized model will have significant impact on the future grid’s ability to provide the electricity more efficiently, reliably, with higher resiliency. This dissertation is divided into two parts: (1) to achieve greater resiliency, it proposes an integrated T\textbackslash\&D co-simulation framework that considers the effects of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) in the distribution. (2) to achieve greater reliability, improved system protection is needed at the distribution level that considers the DER affect such as two-way power flow, low fault currents, etc. This dissertation proposes and analyzes the travelling-wave (TW) based protection at the distribution level. Integrated T\textbackslash\&D framework and the TW based protection improves the grid to be more reliable and resilient.},

The corrective actions adopted during outages in power distribution networks include reconfiguration through switching control and emergency load shedding. The conventional decision-making models for outage mitigation are, however, not suitable for "smart grids" due to their slow response and computational inefficiency. Here, we present a new reinforcement learning (RL) model for outage management in the distribution network to enhance its resilience. The distinctive characteristic of our approach is that it explicitly accounts for the underlying network topology and its variations with switching control, while also capturing the complex interdependencies between state variables (along nodes and edges) by modeling the task as a graph learning problem. Our model learns the  optimal control policy for power restoration using a Capsule-based graph neural network. We validate our model on two test networks, namely the 13 and 34-bus modified IEEE networks where it is shown to achieve near-optimal, real-time performance with up to 5 orders of magnitude improvement in computational speed. The resilience improvement of our model in terms of loss of energy is 4.204 MWs and 13.522 MWs for 13 and 34 buses, respectively. Our model also demonstrates generalizability across a broad range of outage scenarios.},

  abstract = {Local energy markets are emerging as a tool for coordinating generation, storage, and consumption of energy from distributed resources. In combination with automation, they promise to provide an effective energy management framework that is fair and brings system-level savings. The cooperative–competitive nature of energy markets calls for multi-agent based automation with learning energy trading agents. However, depending on the dynamics of the agent–environment interaction, this approach may yield unintended behavior of market participants. Thus, the design of market mechanisms suitable for reinforcement learning agents must take into account this interplay. This article introduces autonomous local energy exchange (ALEX) as an experimental framework that combines multi-agent learning and double auction mechanism. Participants determine their internal price signals and make energy management decisions through market interactions, rather than relying on predetermined external price signals. The main contribution of this article is examination of compatibility between specific market elements and independent learning agents. Effects of different market properties are evaluated through simulation experiments, and the results are used for determine a suitable market design. The results show that market truthfulness maintains demand-response functionality, while weak budget balancing provides a strong reinforcement signal for the learning agents. The resulting agent behavior is compared with two baselines: net billing and time-of-use rates. The ALEX-based pricing is more responsive to fluctuations in the community net load compared to the time-of-use. The more accurate accounting of renewable energy usage reduced bills by a median 38.8\% compared to net billing, confirming the ability to better facilitate demand response.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to solve a cooperative, multi-agent Volt-Var Control (VVC) problem for high solar penetration distribution systems. The ingenuity of our RL method lies in a novel two-stage progressive training strategy that can effectively improve training speed and convergence of the machine learning algorithm. In Stage 1 (individual training), while holding all the other agents inactive, we separately train each agent to obtain its own optimal VVC actions in the action space: consume, generate, do-nothing. In Stage 2 (cooperative training), all agents are trained again coordinately to share VVC responsibility. Rewards and costs in our RL scheme include (i) a system-level reward (for taking an action), (ii) an agent-level reward (for doing-nothing), and (iii) an agent-level action cost function. This new framework allows rewards to be dynamically allocated to each agent based on their contribution while accounting for the trade-off between control effectiveness and action cost. The proposed methodology is tested and validated in a modified IEEE 123-bus system using realistic PV and load profiles. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach is robust, and computationally efficient and achieves desirable volt-var control performance under a wide range of operation conditions.},
