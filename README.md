# DSS Extensions: hub repository

**This repository will be populated throughout July-August 2022. Check back regularly or use the "Watch" feature on GitHub to keep up-to-date.**

This GitHub repository will be used to concentrate documentation, discussions, benchmark results, and i18n/locale files around all projects hsoted in the DSS Extensions organization. 

DSS Extensions were originally meant to expose the official OpenDSS engine to multiple languages and platforms with minimal changes. 
Since 2019, that goal has been reached and the target moved to modernize the our base library (DSS C-API) and add useful extension and modification to the DSS engine.

Projects currently hosted on this organization use several languages (Pascal, C, C++, Python, Julia, C#, MATLAB) and there have been requests and comments from users interested language bindings for other languages like Java, Go, and Rust. 
To avoid upsetting one the language bindings when updating the base library, sometimes we cannot change certain aspects of the base library. This is the place to raise concerns and suggestions about such topics.
