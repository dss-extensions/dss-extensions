# DSS Extensions: hub repository

**This repository will be populated throughout July-August 2022. Check back regularly or use the "Watch" feature on GitHub to keep up-to-date.**

This GitHub repository will be used to concentrate documentation, discussions, benchmark results, and i18n/locale files around all projects hsoted in the DSS Extensions organization. *As a reminder, the projects hosted here are not supported by EPRI.*

DSS Extensions were originally meant to expose the official OpenDSS engine to multiple languages and platforms with minimal changes. 
Since 2019, that goal has been reached and the target moved to modernize the our base library (DSS C-API) and add useful extensions and modifications to the DSS engine.

Projects currently hosted on this organization use several languages (Pascal, C, C++, Python, Julia, C#, MATLAB) and there have been requests and comments from users interested language bindings for other languages like Java, Go, and Rust. 
To avoid upsetting one of the language bindings when updating the base library, sometimes we cannot change certain aspects of the current implementation. This is the place to raise concerns and suggestions about such topics.

Several pre-2022 issues from the other projects were transferred to the issue tracker here. Even though the wording on those may suggest the original project/language, they present challenges or tasks shared across all projects.

Although we have the Discussions feature is enabled, there is no intention in fragmenting the OpenDSS community. We recommend checking and considering posting to the official OpenDSS forum if it's a general OpenDSS question or issue (if possible, test with the official OpenDSS GUI or using the official COM version).

- Official OpenDSS docs at https://sourceforge.net/p/electricdss/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/Version8/Distrib/Doc/ and [OpenDSS_COM.chm](https://sourceforge.net/p/electricdss/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/Version8/Distrib/x64/OpenDSS_COM.chm?format=raw)
- Better search: use a search engine such as Google with `inurl:https://sourceforge.net/p/electricdss/discussion/` and your keywords; [example](https://www.google.com/search?q=inurl%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fp%2Felectricdss%2Fdiscussion%2F+DSS+Extensions).


## API Documentation

Currently we have:

- [DSS C-API Pascal docs](https://dss-extensions.org/dss-extensions/pascal/): Documentation generated from the Pascal source code using PasDoc. This could be useful for someone studying the OpenDSS internals, especially of our implementation. [The class diagram](http://dss-extensions.org/dss-extensions/pascal/GVClasses.svg) is especially useful.
- [DSS C-API headers and dss.hpp](https://dss-extensions.org/dss_capi/): Documentation generated from the C headers and the new (WIP) C++ header library, including the classic API and the newest API extensions.
- [DSS Python reference](https://dss-extensions.org/dss_python/): Minor notes and API docs; besides the classic API, this includes initial docs of the new Obj API.
- [DSS Sharp reference](https://dss-extensions.org/dss_sharp/): General API docs generated by the Sandcastle Help File Builder.
- [OpenDSSDirect.jl](https://dss-extensions.org/OpenDSSDirect.jl/stable/): Minor notes and API docs; needs some updates.
- [OpenDSSDirect.py](https://dss-extensions.org/OpenDSSDirect.py/): Minor notes and API docs; needs some updates.
